      <description>Fourteen Depression-era UC Berkeley students, guided by the campus YMCA general secretary Harry L. Kingman, established a house that would launch the University of California Students' Cooperative Association. Now known as the Berkeley Student Cooperative (BSC), the student-owned and student-operated non-profit cooperative has continued to grow since its founding, offering several affordable housing options to UC Berkeley students and those at other Bay Area colleges and universities. This exhibition celebrates the 80th anniversary of the BSC, the largest student cooperative in the United States, with photographs, brochures, publications, correspondence, and other documents drawn from the BSC records and other collections in the University Archives. It explores its origins, traditions, artistic activities, political involvement, and environmental sustainability efforts.</description>

      <title>Dawn of the Computer Age, thru Feb 15, 2014</title>

      <description>In March of 1953 there were 53 kilobytes of high-speed random-access memory on planet Earth. As of 2013, you can put 64 gb of memory in your pocket for $399. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
George Dysonâ€™s Turingâ€™s Cathedral tells part of the story of the sixty years between these two milestones, and is also the focus of this yearâ€™s â€œOn the Same Pageâ€ program, which gives the UC Berkeley campus community something to talk about. The program theme is The Dawn of the Computer Age, which refers both to the time period in which the ENIAC and MANIAC computers were created and also to our own day and age, when progress in technology is occurring so fast that we are only beginning to see and understand the repercussions of the computer age. Check the â€œOn the Same Pageâ€ web site (http://onthesamepage.berkeley.edu ) for details on the many opportunities for participating in this campus-wide discussion, both online and in person.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
The new exhibit at Moffitt Library celebrates the â€œDawn of the Computer Ageâ€ and features copies of two of Alan Turingâ€™s most influential journal articles, a Tiny Turing Machine, images of early computing machines, a live view of the campus Turing Test Tournament, a video of Professor Christos Papadimitriou of the Computer Science department explaining the significance of Turingâ€™s work, and a brief history of personal computer hardware (PDP-8, anyone?).</description>

      <title>Deities, Demons, and Teachers of Tibet, Nepal, and India, thru Apr 13, 2014</title>
      <link>http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=67216&amp;date=2013-11-17</link>
      <description>Joyful and sensual sculptural figures of Indian deities and dancers join radiant images of enlightened beings from Tibet and Nepal in Deities, Demons, and Teachers, which presents a rotating display of works by anonymous Indian, Nepalese, and Tibetan artisans. A tenth-century sandstone figure of Ganesha, the elephant-headed deity worshipped by Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists, graces the entrance to the exhibition, a site appropriate to Ganeshaâ€™s role in removing obstacles and blessing any new endeavor. Whether viewed as a cosmic dancer or a cavorting adolescent, this image of Ganesha is confirmation of the wonder and delight to be found in the sculpture and painting of these ancient cultures.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Hindus and Buddhists both revere and celebrate female deities and often depict goddesses in idealized form with exaggerated marks of beauty. In Dancing Devi, a twelfth-century buff-sandstone sculpture from central India, the beauty of the bejeweled and crowned figure is accentuated by the larger-than-life proportions of breasts and buttocks. A more reserved but no less beautifully idealized feminine form is seen in Tara, a seventeenth-century Nepalese bronze, where the figure is surrounded by a fanciful garden of birds, musicians, and garlands.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Very early images of the Buddha are rare, so it is quite exceptional that in addition to the massive bronze fourteenth-century Tibetan Buddha in the center of the gallery, this exhibition also features a stone image of a third-century seated Buddha from the Swat Valley and a tenth- or eleventh-century bronze Standing Buddha from Western Tibet. An array of bodhisattvas and attendant deities from these regions, including a painting of the Thirteenth Karmapa (at left), believed to be a reincarnation of the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, fill out the gathered celestial realm of the Buddhist cosmology.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Deities, Demons, and Teachers is organized by Senior Curator for Asian Art&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

      <link>http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=67219&amp;date=2013-11-17</link>
      <description>Beauty Revealed: Images of Women in Qing Dynasty Chinese Painting investigates a relatively unexamined area of Chinese art history: meiren (beautiful women) paintings from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. This exhibition is the first to bring together a broad selection of paintings in this genre, and includes work from public and private collections in the United States and Europe, as well as from the BAM/PFA collection. Organized by Senior Curator for Asian Art Julia M. White in collaboration with UC Berkeley Professor Emeritus James Cahill, one of the world's leading scholars of Chinese painting, the exhibition is accompanied by a catalog with essays by Cahill, White, Sarah Handler, and Chen Fongfong with a contribution by Nancy Berliner.</description>

      <title>Linda Stark / Matrix 250, thru Dec 22</title>
      <link>http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=68213&amp;date=2013-11-17</link>
      <description>Matrix 250 features the work of Los Angelesâ€“based artist Linda stark (b.1956), who has been making figurative and abstract paintings with heavily built-up surfaces of paint since the late 1980s. This presentation showcases approximately fifteen paintings made by the artist over the last two decades, highlighting her more recent series of â€œadornmentâ€ and â€œbrandedâ€ paintings, which conflate the surface textures of the painting with various aspects of the female body, primarily flesh. The artist drips and meticulously builds layers of thick oil paint in her modestly scaled works, the largest of which measure three feet square and the smallest seven inches square. She engages with the physical aspects of paint, repeatedly turning the canvas on its side to build up a dense network of layers, which sometimes appear more sculptural than painterly.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Stark frequently spends several years working on her luscious surfaces, underscoring the temporal and material properties of oil paint.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Inspired by transcendent, universal themes, as well as common utilitarian patterns, stark has created a distinctive body of work organized around central motifs: spirals, rotations, weave patterns, fountains, flames, crosses, flesh, animals, and water. The female body, shown in abstracted close-ups, has been a particular focus of her oeuvre, as witnessed in diverse representations of female genitalia and other fragmented body parts (belly buttons, hair, nipples, tattoos, etc.). Yet for all her attention to the surface of the painting, what inevitably manifests is a deeply felt interest in human psychology and spiritual, or even supernatural, subjects. stark filters these concerns through a playful pop aesthetic, often producing a cheerful yet disturbing affect.</description>

      <title>Yang Fudong, thru Dec 8</title>
      <link>http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=68529&amp;date=2013-11-17</link>
      <description>This first midcareer survey of the work of Yang Fudong (b. 1971) presents films, multichannel videos, and photographs by a leading figure in Chinaâ€™s contemporary art world and independent cinema movement.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Yangâ€™s work reflects the ideals and anxieties of the generation born during and after the Cultural Revolution that is struggling to find its place in the rapidly changing society of the new China. Although he draws much of his subject matter from the consumerist contexts of contemporary urban China, many of his images recall the literati paintings of seventeenth-century China (Yang first trained in painting before switching to photography and filmmaking). His films and film installations have an atemporal and dreamlike quality, marked by long and suspended sequences, dividing narratives, and multiple relationships and storylines. In his recent installations, Yang reflects on the process of filmmaking itself, creating spatially open-ended multichannel films that he calls a contemporary form of the Chinese hand scroll.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Our presentation of Yangâ€™s work includes twenty years of photographs and video and film installations in the galleries; a film series at the PFA Theater co-curated by the artist that focuses on works that have influenced him, ranging from the Golden Age of Chinese cinema of the 1930s and 1940s to the Fifth Generation filmmakers who rose to prominence in the 1980s; and a continuous loop of Yangâ€™s single-channel films daily at midday in the Museum Theater. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Yang Fudong: Estranged Paradise, Works 1993â€“2013 is organized by BAM/PFA Adjunct Senior Curator Philippe Pirotte and presented by BAM/PFA and the Kunsthalle ZÃ¼rich. The exhibition is made possible in part by an anonymous donor;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Marian Goodman Gallery; ShanghART Gallery; Dr. Rosalyn M. Laudati and Dr. James Pick; the Sifang Art Museum, Nanjing; the W.L.S. Spencer Foundation; Rena Bransten; Nion McEvoy; and April and Glenn Bucksbaum.</description>

      <title>Multiple Encounters, thru Feb 2, 2014</title>
      <link>http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=70819&amp;date=2013-11-17</link>
      <description>Multiple encounters puts the video work of Yang Fudong in direct dialogue with historical Chinese paintings, a juxtaposition that raises questions about how we view both Yangâ€™s work and classical art. Connecting the fifteenth century to the twenty-first, this exhibition suggests that some of the magical qualities of Yangâ€™s work may be inherited from the Chinese classical tradition.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Ten classical paintings, in traditional formats, are displayed together with Yangâ€™s seven-minute single-channel video The Half Hitching Post (2005). The video tells the story of two young men moving to an isolated village at the same time a young couple struggles to escape it. The journey takes place on the Loess Plateau in northern China, where the grandeur and timelessness of the landscape recall images from classical paintings. (Yang first studied painting at the China Academy of Fine Arts in Hangzhou before switching to photography and film.)&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Yangâ€™s cinematic aesthetics, presenting a multiplicity of views by constructing numerous narratives, intriguingly echo the multipoint perspectives of classical painting. For example, Wen Zhengmingâ€™s sixteeth-century Landscape with Figures depicts mountains with several paths that provide ways for the figures in the painting to meet at some future point. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;

      <title>Art for Human Rights, Nov 13-24</title>
      <link>http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=70820&amp;date=2013-11-17</link>
      <description>In 2004 and 2005, internationally acclaimed artist Fernando Botero&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
created a torrent of charged paintings and drawings for his renowned&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Abu Ghraib series. The brutish and compelling images of detention&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
and imminent physical and psychic threat are still charged with&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
recent memories of the horrifying revelations of prisoner abuse&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Four works from this powerful series&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
are on view in the Bancroft Lobby as part of Art for Human Rights.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Four additional paintings by Botero are displayed at Boalt Hall on&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
the UC Berkeley campus. Art for Human Rights coincides with the&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
November 13 screening of Susana de Sousa Diasâ€™s film 48, about&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
political prisoners in Portugal.</description>

      <title>Danish String Quartet, Nov 17</title>
      <link>http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=70080&amp;date=2013-11-17</link>
      <description>You will say you heard them here first. The Danish String Quartet, impossibly young and preternaturally gifted, has roused the classical music world like a gust of crisp Scandinavian air. Recognized for performances of incredible focus, uncanny ensemble cohesion, and an easy, natural virtuosity, the quartet won first prize in the London International String Quartet Competition in 2009. This season, it joins the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center's CMS Two program, a prestigious incubator for emerging ensembles. In its Cal Performances debut, the quartet plays Beethoven's String Quartet No. 15, praised by the New York Times as "one of the most powerful renditions...I've heard live or on a recording." &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Sightlines pre-performance talk from 2-2:30. Free to ticket holders.</description>

      <title>Ruins, Manuel Mozos (Portugal, 2009), Nov 17</title>
      <link>http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=71102&amp;date=2013-11-17</link>
      <description>(RuÃ­nas). Manuel Mozosâ€™s fugue film captures the decaying beauty of the Portuguese landscape. Contemplative long takes of the ruins of empty castles, crumbling pilgrimâ€™s quarters, dilapidated factories, and abandoned homes are coupled with voiceover narration of documents from the buildingsâ€™ eras: plague notices from the sixteenth century, the love letters of a nun from the seventeenth, even hotel-booking requests from the early twentieth. Ruins has a quiet visual poetry similar to the landscape cinema of James Benning, only fleshed out with a saudade-fueled sorrow that seems to ooze from the Portuguese setting.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

      <description>In conversation/Susana de Sousa Dias, JoÃ£o Pedro Rodrigues, and Nuno Lisboa&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
(Natureza morta). In her poetic first film, de Sousa Dias delves into a fascinating array of archival images from the period of the Salazar dictatorship. Official images and political propaganda films are slowed down and freed from their original soundtracks. By combining this footage with photos of political prisoners, the film allows us to meditate on how the authoritarian regimeâ€”as well as, more innocently, cinema itselfâ€”â€œstill lives.â€&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

(O corpo de Afonso) Rodrigues asks questions of disparate men in his innovative new film, which is both a casting session and a history lesson. (30 mins, In Galician with English subtitles, Color, Digital video, From Agencia da Curta Metragem)&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

      <title>UniÃ³n Tanguera: Nuit Blanche, Nov 17</title>

      <description>Combining the sensuality and intimacy of social dance with the formal expressivity of grand theater, UniÃ³n Tanguera's latest work features a cast of virtuoso tango dancers and musicians in a story set in a nightclub over the course of a single sleepless night, or nuit blanche. The French Argentinian ensemble is co-directed by Claudia Codega and Esteban Moreno, who studied with the greatest tango maestros of the 1980s and 1990s, and who now represent a new generation of tango choreographers whose work "intelligently reinterprets the vocabulary of pure tango" (Danseur). The company visits on its first American tour, with an ensemble of first-call Buenos Aires musicians and a production "perfect in rhythm and spirit" (Ballet 2000).</description>

      <title>BareStage Presents: "Wonder Girl", Nov 15-24</title>
      <link>http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=70618&amp;date=2013-11-17</link>
      <description>Everyone wants to be a hero because no one can imagine a hero losing. From the mind of award-winning playwright and Cal student Weston Scott,Wonder Girl tells the story of a teenage girl that gains super powers, along with the responsibility that shapes it. As she decidedly tries to make the world into a better place, she faces incompetent super heroes, pun-loving masterminds, and apathetic townspeople who all have differing visions of an ideal community. An impactful and engaging score by local musician Stefano Flavoni illuminates the world of comic books from the initial triumphant notes to the final, longing refrain. By questioning the true meaning of a hero, Wonder Girl examines a world in which the protagonist canâ€™t win, but wants nothing else. Combining humor, action, music, and the tragic, this musical is a true whirlwind force that drives toward an exhilarating ending. Wonder Girl-Someone Better Shake Things Up.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Shows are at 8pm friday and Saturday &amp; 5pm on Sunday</description>
