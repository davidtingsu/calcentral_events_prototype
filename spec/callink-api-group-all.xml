      <Summary>The American Nuclear Society serves its members in their efforts to develop and safely apply nuclear science and technology for public benefit through knowledge exchange, professional development, and enhanced public understanding.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p style="margin-top: 12px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"&gt;The American Nuclear Society is a not-for-profit, international, scientific and educational organization.&amp;nbsp; It was established by a group of individuals who recognized the need to unify the professional activities within the diverse fields of nuclear science and technology.&amp;nbsp; December 11, 1954, marks the Society&amp;rsquo;s historic beginning at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C.&amp;nbsp; ANS has since developed a multifarious membership composed of approximately 10,500 engineers, scientists, administrators, and educators representing 1,600 plus corporations, educational institutions, and government agencies.&amp;nbsp; It is governed by three officers and a board of directors elected by the membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 12px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"&gt;&lt;strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"&gt;We, The Student Chapter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 12px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"&gt;The American Nuclear Society (ANS) Student Branch at University of California Berkeley is a subsidiary of the National ANS. The main objectives of the ANS Student Branch is consistent with those of the National ANS, which is to promote the advancement of science and engineering relating to the atomic nucleus and of allied sciences and arts.We are formed and managed by a group of students interested to contribute toward the development of nuclear science and technology at the University of California through activities in which student members and faculty may participate.Most of us are students in the Nuclear Engineering Department but we welcome students from all backgrounds to join us. The only requirements we ask for is a desire to learn and an open-mind for new technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 12px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"&gt;We organize events for the benefit of our own members as well as to promote understanding of nuclear technology on campus. The recent focus of this society has been to increase public awareness of the many benefits of nuclear technology and its place in our future. With the increasing threats of nuclear terrorism, our aim is to educate the public on the safety issues and responsibilities related to nuclear power generation as well as the peaceful use of nuclear materials in medical radiation as well as food processing industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 12px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"&gt;Our student section has sent many students to the ANS national conferences over the years. In 2002, UC Berkeley-ANS sponsored the National Student Conference for ANS and the conference was a tremendous success in bringing together students from all over the country to present information on latest technology in the field and to foster interaction between like-minded current and future scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 12px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"&gt;&lt;strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Associated Students of the University of California are the elected representatives of the UC Berkeley student body.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Berkeley Cambodian Student Association was originally founded to unite and support people who share an interest in Cambodia and Cambodian culture by fostering an appreciation of that culture.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over the years, the Berkeley Cambodian Student Association has evolved to place greater emphasis upon recognizing and sharing the Cambodian-American experience with the UC Berkeley community. The Cambodian-American story is neither a relic of the past nor an inert fact of today. Thus, the Berkeley Cambodian Student Association aims to reclaim Cambodian cultural and political histories, create socially aware individuals, inspire leadership and service, and bridge generations. We aim to eliminate the invisibility of the Cambodian-American community and empower its members.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <Summary>BOAA is an ASUC-sponsored student organization on the UC Berkeley campus. We have weekly meetings to discuss animal rights issues, plan events to advocate for animals, and enjoy yummy vegan food! </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;The Berkeley Organization for Animal Advocacy is the campus' only social justice group dedicated to raising awareness about issues of animal oppression. We, at BOAA, firmly stand against the abusive, gendered, and exploitative nature of the treatment of animals in our society. We believe that the ills of factory farming are felt not only by non-human animals, but also by the environment, people of color, low income people, and the health and culture of our society. As a group, we are dedicated to raising awareness and promoting compassionate, socially just, and sustainable diets, and advocating for the liberation of animals from systems of human oppression. We participate in vegan and vegetarian outreach on campus and work in partnership with other local animal rights groups to better the lives of non-human animals.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>Berkeley Students for Life (BSL) recognizes the inherent and inviolable dignity of human life. We are dedicated to working within our campus and local community to provide the resources necessary to make this happen.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Berkeley Students for Life: Mission Statement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As UC Berkeley&amp;rsquo;s pro-life student group, Berkeley Students for Life (BSL) recognizes the inherent and inviolable dignity of human life, from that of the unborn to that of the aged and terminally ill. We are dedicated to working within our campus and local community to put an end to abortion, embryonic stem cell research and euthanasia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since BSL is based at a prestigious educational institution, we see the need to educate our community about the truths surrounding offenses against human life. To that end, we facilitate and engage in intellectual discussion on relevant issues, challenging widely held relativist assumptions on the dignity of human life, the role of individual autonomy and society's role in protecting human life. Through these means, we seek to convince hearts and minds of the horrors of the offenses against life. We desire to convert society so that it might be more receptive to a culture of life that fully recognizes the dignity of every human being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we aim to form leaders that will encourage the development of a more just society grounded in the recognition of the inherent and transcendent value of human life. We seek to enter our respective professions armed with the knowledge and tools needed to uphold the dignity of life in every facet of society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also at the heart of BSL&amp;rsquo;s mission is its commitment to community service. We believe that socioeconomic circumstances do not justify the taking of human life, and we affirm that such difficulties can be overcome. To that end, BSL provides information to assist women facing crisis pregnancies and refers them to local crisis pregnancy centers that provide women with what they need to bring new life into the world. We also volunteer at local crisis pregnancy centers to help promote their mission to encourage the bringing of new life into our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the focus of our outreach is primarily local, we collaborate with other pro-life organizations from around our state and nation and are united to them by virtue of our common cause. As a member of California Students for Life (CASTL), BSL is an active participant in the development of pro-life student activism at the state level. We also collaborate with Students for Life of America in order to engage in the fight for life at the national level. As an organization that concerns itself with matters of great public relevance, BSL strives to do everything in its capacity to shape public opinion on relevant university, state and federal policies, as well as to influence said policies, so that these might more accurately reflect our vision for a world in which every human life is valued and protected.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Dragonboat is an ancient sport originating in China where multiple boats, each consisting of 20 paddlers, race against each other to victory. Today, dragonboat has become one of the fastest growing water sports in the world, with teams ranging from San Francisco to Australia. Our team is composed of a group of loud and crazy college kids who aim to become one of the fastest teams out on the water. During the school year, we practice 2-3 times a week on the water at Alameda Bay and twice a week on campus near the RSF. Our team races in various competitions around the Bay Area and Long Beach about 6 times a year. Next year, our team plans on competing in Vancouver at the Rio Tinto Alcan Dragonboat festival, one of the largest competitions in the world with over 200 teams competing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in joining our team, please feel free to contact one of our captains for more information about recruitment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>We are a friendly group of runners who meet 6 days a week for running and fun. To join the Cal Running Club, all you have to do is show up! We meet at Kroeber Fountain, at the cross of Bancroft and College (across the street from Cafe Strada).</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cal Running Club&lt;/strong&gt; is a student-run running group at UC Berkeley. We meet 6 days a week, rain or shine, pay no membership fees, and have a lot of fun running with other students who also enjoy running. If you like running, you should definitely come check us out!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We meet for 3~5+ mile runs at 5pm, Monday through Friday, at Kroeber Fountain (at the cross of Bancroft and College, across from Cafe Strada). We also have Sunday morning long runs this semester at 9am, also at Kroeber Fountain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Rules of Running Club:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. -&lt;strong&gt;No iPods/CD players/MP3 players/etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;More generally,&amp;nbsp;anything that lowers your ability to hear during runs is banned. We like to keep our runners safe and healthy, and staying alert while running on the dangerous streets of Berkeley is part of that effort. Plus, this means its easier to socialize during runs =)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. -&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;No iPods/CD players/MP3 players/etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Our mission is to create a safe space on campus for students and community members to explore and share themselves, their experiences and their world through words. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; For the uninitiated, poetry slam is an oral poetry competition in which poets bring to the mic their original work, and are given scores based on their writing and performance from judges (picked randomly from the audience) on a scale of 1-10. In general, poetry slams are loud, high-energy, and brashly honest. Poets bring their original work to compete for a chance to represent UC Berkeley at the ACUI-hosted College Union Poetry Slam. Anyone can sign up to read, but only students, staff, and employees can make the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cal Slam hosts events throughout the semester and features the best performing artists from the Bay Area to the Atlantic Ocean&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;The civil engineering honor society--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dedicated to the purpose of maintaining and promoting the status of civil engineering as an ideal profession, Chi Epsilon was organized to recognize the characteristics of the individual civil engineer deemed to be fundamental to the successful pursuit of an engineering career, and to aid in the development of those characteristics in the civil engineering student. Engineering, the application of scientific principles to the practical needs of society, is assuming a constantly increasing responsibility for the physical well-being of all people, and thus calling for competence of the highest order. This responsibility can be discharged only by a professional group whose members are possessed of a good basic technical ability, intelligence, moral integrity, and effective social poise in their relationship with the larger community of which they are part. To contribute to the improvement of the profession, Chi Epsilon fosters the development and exercise of sound traits of character and technical ability among civil engineers, and its members, by precept and example, toward an ever higher standard of professional service.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <ShortName>CRSSO</ShortName>
      <Summary>The purpose of CRSSO is to foster community among past, present and future Conservation and Resource Studies majors by providing academic support, networking, volunteer and social opportunities. </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;The Conservation and Resource Studies Student Organization is a cohort within the College of Natural Resources comprised of current, past, and prospective CRS students. We embody the colleges' "See the Bigger Picture. Make a Better World" tagline as we are a community striving to make a more socially just, ecologically friendly, and sustainable way of life. The CRSSO actively engages with ESPM 90, the introductory course to the major, to help guide the students in the formation of their Area of Interest. The CRSSO serves as a hub to discuss important issues in our society and shows students how they can tailor their AOI around these complex issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also offer students a taste of what research at Berkeley is like by acting as a platform where seniors post their research thesis and link up with other students interested in that field of study. Our goal is to set up a senior mentor/ underclassmen mentee program to further utilize the interdisciplinary design of our major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large focus of the CRSSO is the Alternative Graduation ceremony each May for CRS graduating seniors. The CRSSO is the entire basis behind organizing and implementing the event as well as for the healthy growth of Living Diplomas which are handed to each graduating senior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from activities within our own major, the CRSSO organizes fun events and promotes volunteer opportunities both on and off campus.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>The purpose of Danceworx is to provide an outlet for dancers to perform and also to provide an opportunity for dancers to learn and improve technique, while in a fun and supportive environment.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danceworx was founded in 1988 and is the oldest student-run dance group on the UC Berkeley campus.&lt;/strong&gt; For over 20 years, we have been providing students with a creative outlet to choreograph, dance, and perform in a fun and supportive environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dancers are selected at the beginning of each semester and practice routines in various styles: &lt;strong&gt;Jazz/Lyrical&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Hip Hop&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tap&lt;/strong&gt;. Throughout the semester, we host social events such as Bowling, Movie Nights and our End of the Semester Banquet so our dancers can get to know each other better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each semester culminates in three performances: two outdoor showcases on the UC Berkeley campus and an evening showcase in a local theater venue. Our showcases attract over 400 attendees each semester and also feature guest performances from campus and local community groups to foster unity and promote diversity among UC Berkeley&amp;rsquo;s performing arts community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danceworx also performs at campus and local events. If you would like Danceworx to perform at one of your events, please contact our Outreach Chair (&lt;a href="mailto:dwxoutreach@gmail.com"&gt;dwxoutreach@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

      <Status>Active</Status>
      <ShortName />
      <Summary>UC Berkeley's premier South Asian Acapella team</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;UC Berkeley's Dil Se was founded by Arjun Ohri in 2004 after many semesters of being just a dream. Dil Se combines the melody-based raagas of Hindi Film Music with the depth and harmony that drive western music to create a fresh perspective on the tradition of a cappella. The group combines a wide range of experience, from years of training in Hindustani and Carnatic music, to Western Classical and Jazz Choirs, and even countless mornings of singing in the shower. Our goal is to entertain the audience with a well-rounded performance that emanates Dil Se -- "from the heart".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Name>Eggster Organization</Name>
      <Status>Active</Status>
      <ShortName>EGG</ShortName>
      <Summary>Eggster is a non-profit student organization located in Berkeley with a focus on volunteering in the lower-income community. Every year we organize and run the Eggster Egghunt and Learning Festival, the largest free egghunt in Northern California. </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000000;"&gt;Eggster is non-profit student group and is composed of three committees:&amp;nbsp;Finance,&amp;nbsp;Event,&amp;nbsp;Public Community Relations. Each of these committees provides an opportunity for members to develop an array of skills in leadership, communication, community networking, event planning, advertising, and fundraising. Our activities include planning our annual, free, on-campus Eggster Hunt and Learning Festival, going on volunteer outreaches in the Berkeley area, and raising money for our agencies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000000;"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Event Committee&amp;nbsp;accounts for just that, the event. Every year, their creative minds come up with atheme&amp;nbsp;and about 30 corresponding booths for the children to enjoy. They not only&amp;nbsp;research and create learning and activity booths, but also acquire the necessary materials and supplies through in-kind donations. They also&amp;nbsp;train the 300 volunteers&amp;nbsp;through orientations about a month before the big day. They design the egg hunts and have recently added obstacle courses to physically challenge the children.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="x_x_x_x_Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 20px; color: #000000;"&gt;&lt;span class="x_x_x_x_Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 20px;"&gt;Each committee is made up of two leaders ("Eggheads") and about 3-5 members. The two "Overalls" are the leaders in charge of the "Eggheads" and the Social/Admin "Eggheads" have their own responsibilities but do not head a committee.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br style="outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" /&gt; &lt;br style="outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000000;"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"&gt;Finance Committee&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;takes on all fiscal responsibilities. In addition to doing organizational bookkeeping such as&amp;nbsp;tracking the budget&amp;nbsp;andprocessing reimbursements, they also work to&amp;nbsp;acquire prize donations&amp;nbsp;for the winners of the raffle drawing held at every event. Finance is also in charge of&amp;nbsp;writing grant and corporate applications, which constitute much of Eggster's budget.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000000;"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Social Historian and Technology chair&amp;nbsp;records minutes, organizes social events, and compiles a scrapbook at the end of the year. SHA also designs and periodically updates Eggster's website, which is essential for communication within the student group and with the greater university and Bay Area community.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="x_x_x_x_Apple-style-span" style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 20px;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000000;"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"&gt;Public Community Relations Committee&lt;/span&gt;(PCR) consists of the recent combinations of two committees: Public Relations (PR) and Community Relations (Comrel). PCR deals with both the public and the community aspects of the organization. PCR advertise for our event directly to low-income elementary schools, and are involved throughout the entire process of inviting, choosing, and working with our beneficiaries. PCR is also responsible for attaining food and candy donations for the egg hunt. In doing so we work with small businesses as well as large corporations. PCR networks with elementary schools, small businesses, corporations, and non-profits in the Bay Area.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

Each week's location will be posted on our online media outlets. We also meet together in mid-week small groups.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Join us as we delve deeply into the Bible and study how it speaks to us today. We will read and discuss, discover and apply, and encourage and support each other each week as we come to know and love God. Everybody is welcome!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>Fei Tian is a group of dancers who promote cultural awareness through Chinese dance performances from many of China's ethnic groups and by providing Cal students with a beginning dance decal.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;As UC Berkeley's only Chinese dance performing group, Fei Tian Dancers (FTD), strives to cultivate an on-campus atmosphere that welcomes and appreciates the abundant diversity of the Berkeley community. FTD performs at many functions in Berkeley and around the Bay Area, showcasing the multifarious ethnic dances of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese people consists of more than 50 ethnic minorities, and each group's cultures and lifestyles are illustrated and expressed through the performing arts. FTD provides an opportunity for all those interested to enhance their Chinese ethnic dance techniques and skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the performing group forms the core of Fei Tian Dancers, the group also facilitates a Beginning Chinese Dance DeCal every semester and hosts free monthly workshops. Everyone is invited to join the DeCal and come to these workshops, regardless of gender, ethnicity, or dance experience.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Summary>Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated is an international service organization that was founded at Howard University in Washington, D.C. on January 15, 1908. It is the oldest Greek-lettered organization established by African American college women.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Since its founding over a century ago, Alpha Kappa Alpha&amp;rsquo;s mission has been to cultivate and encourage high scholastic and ethical standards, to promote unity and friendship among college women, to study and help alleviate problems concerning girls and women in order to improve their social stature, to maintain a progressive interest in college life, and to be of &amp;ldquo;Service to All Mankind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rho Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated was chartered at the University of California, Berkeley on August 21, 1921 by 6 women under the leadership of Soror Ida Louise Jackson. With the chartering of Rho Chapter, the landmark expansion of the sorority to the West Coast began. Rho women have been striving to fulfill Ida&amp;rsquo;s dream of nothing short of excellence for the chapter. The women of Rho exemplify the Alpha Kappa Alpha woman through their commitment to academic excellence at Cal and beyond, professional and personal development, community service, and their sisterhood.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>Alternative Breaks offers service-learning trips during academic breaks for UC Berkeley students to explore a social justice issue through education, reflection, and immersion into an impacted community.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p class="x_rteleft"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: smaller;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana;"&gt;Since its founding in 2001, Alternative Breaks has been a service-learning program that offers students opportunities to connect to the greater community through meaningful service, education, and reflection during their academic breaks. Many participants return from their experiences with greater insight on a particular social justice issue and a deeper understanding on what it means to get involved in the community. This year, Alternative Breaks offers ten trips to different locations during the spring break, covering issues such as environmental justice, health care, immigration, and homelessness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="x_rteleft"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: smaller;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana;"&gt;These student-led trips travel to different locations in California and throughout the Western United States to further understanding of the community and to bring knowledge gained on-site back to the Berkeley community.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; Students not only participate in a week-long service trip, but also a spring DeCal course to further explore various topics revolving around each social justice issue and engage in reflection both pre- and post-trip. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <Summary>Yoga, knowledge, meditation, breathwork, service and fun.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Operating in over 150 countries, The Art of Living Foundation (AOLF) is a non-profit, educational and humanitarian organization founded in 1981 by the world-renown philanthropist and spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. All of AOLF&amp;rsquo;s programs are guided by Sri Sri&amp;rsquo;s philosophy: &amp;ldquo;Unless we have a stress-free mind and a violence-free society, we cannot achieve world peace.&amp;rdquo; The AOLF community is diverse and attracts people from all walks of life backgrounds and religious orientations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;AOLF offers numerous highly effective educational and self-development programs and tools that facilitate the elimination of stress and foster deep and profound inner peace, happiness and well-being for all individuals. These programs, which include breathing techniques, meditation, yoga, and practical wisdom for daily living, have helped millions around the world to completely transform their lives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to these courses offered globally, AOLF, working in collaboration with The International Association for Human Values (IAHV), has successfully implemented numerous humanitarian projects and service initiatives including conflict resolution programs, disaster relief, sustainable rural development, empowerment of women, prisoner rehabilitation, education for all, and environmental sustainability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It has been said of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar that not since Mahatma Gandhi has one person united so many people of different races, religions, traditions, economic and social status, and nationalities, creating a One World spiritual family across the globe.&amp;nbsp; Sri Sri&amp;rsquo;s message is simple: &amp;ldquo;Love and wisdom can prevail over hatred and violence.&amp;rdquo; Happily this message is not just a slogan but through AOLF has been and continues to be translated into action and results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sustainability Team is a special program in ASUC established in Fall 2005. As a team, we create and implement a variety of projects that help establish sustainable practices and promote environmental awareness on campus. Project committees within STeam work as a tight unit to accomplish their goals, and leadership capacity is shared equally. STeam is headed by the ASUC Director of Environmental Sustainability (DES) and is institutionalized in the ASUC constitution (Article I, Title 9.26: Director of Environmental Sustainability). STeam members meet all together once a month and separately within project groups every week to update each other on the progress of our projects and brainstorm strategies for successful implementation, and project committees break out into small groups to work on their individual projects. STeam members are unpaid and commit a minimum of 5 hours a week to their projects. The team also spends time outside of meetings through our STeam Socials and Community Service days a few times per semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sustainability Team has coordinated EarthWeek every year since 2006 to celebrate Earth Day and engage the campus community in solutions to environmental issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Fall 2006 STeam partnered with SUPERB to host a Climate Change Fair which featured a screening of Al Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth," as well as many campus and community environmental organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since our founding, Sustainability Team has provided students with reduced free or cost reusable water bottles to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, other toxic pollutants and waste--especially popular are our reduced priced Klean Kanteen stainless steel water bottles!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2007 STeam launched The Local, UC Berkeley's first-ever student-run, nonprofit, cooperative produce stand that sells only locally grown, pesticide free, fresh fruits and vegetables. They're especially affordable since the stand is run completely by volunteers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Fall 2007 and Spring 2008, STeam continued its work with Earthweek and is started two new projects including our Responsible Investments Campaign (RI)and our One-Side-Clean Paper Project (OSC). RI retired at the end of Spring 2009, but OSC is still extremely vibrant and productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2009-2010 academic school year also saw the advent of the Composting Group, Student Team on Zero Waste and Plastics, and Campus Collaboration.&amp;nbsp; Campus Collaboration got absorbed into another entity outside of STeam [B-GAIA/ECO] during Fall 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlights of the 2010-2011 academic year include the successful screening of "Tapped", a movie about the negative externalities associated with bottled water, the creation of our very own bag monster, and the creation of an auditing team for the ASUC's Green Certification pilot program, in which student groups can be actively recognized for their "greening" efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 2011-2012 academic year, STeam had eight project groups: The Local, One Side Clean, Earth Week, Focus the Nation (STeam Energy), End Coal Campaign, Fair Trade University, Student Team on Zero Waste and Plastic (STOP), and Compost Group. Each project group worked hard to create tangible improvements and spread awareness on campus. Highlights include the screening of two documentaries: &lt;em&gt;The Last Mountain&lt;/em&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Waste Land&lt;/em&gt;, attending both the Fall and Spring California Student Sustainability Coalition Convergences, bonding at a STeam Winter Retreat, organizing a fantastic Earth Week 2012, and creating the Guide to Sustainability at Cal video for the CalSO program. We hope that our momentum will continue into the 2012-2013 academic year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are always open to new ideas.&amp;nbsp; The next project we work on could be yours! So come check us out at our meetings and initiate your own ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official STeam website is currently under construction, but the temporary website is&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://calsteam.wordpress.com/"&gt;http://calsteam.wordpress.com/&lt;/a&gt;. Visit it to learn more about project groups and upcomming meetings/events!&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Here at the Berkeley Business Society, our primary goal is to use BBS' extensive network to help members access a bank of internships, mentorships, and networking opportunities while gaining real-world experience and building their professional skills. What sets BBS apart is that we take a personal approach and tailor the club experience to every individual. Our distinct committees--Consulting, Marketing, Finance, Professional Development, Pro-Bono Consulting, Information Technology, Entrepreneurship and Communications--encompass different sectors of business, and members can apply to be in the division that interests them. Furthermore, bi-weekly workshops present skills and opportunities that can be used in any field of business. It is our hope that in BBS you will be able to find an area of business that interests you, and from there we will do our best to help you reach success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mission&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Berkeley Business Society is a close-knit group that aims to develop three things in its members: &lt;strong&gt;Skills, Cohesion and Networking&lt;/strong&gt;. Therefore, all of our activities are geared toward improving the business and analytical skills of our members, expanding the members' professional networks and building up strong cords of friendship within the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Berkeley Business Society changed its name from IABC August 2013)&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

Her firm belief that young people, when informed and empowered, when they realize that what they do truly makes a difference, can indeed change the world, is at the very heart of our program. This powerful message of hope inspires us all. Our program&amp;mdash;dedicated to inspiring tomorrow's leaders today&amp;mdash;not only motivates young people to learn about pertinent issues facing our local and global communities, but helps them actually design, lead and implement their own projects as a means of solving them."&lt;/p&gt;

      <Description>&lt;div class="mhl"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="mhl"&gt;
&lt;div id="id_520ff26ac5f532540216577" class="text_exposed_root"&gt;As Cal's Christian a cappella group, we have come together across campus fellowships and churches to proclaim the good news of the Gospel through song to our campus and community. Our hope is that through music we can better understand and share with others the knowledge that every good thing in us is for the sake of Christ, as expressed in Philemon 1:6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="text_exposed_root"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We were founded by a group of Cal students&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;in 2000. This spring, we celebrate 13 years of God's faithfulness to this group, and our prayer is that you might also be blessed by the joy we experience through Him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FCS has had the privilege of producing 3 studio albums: Nothing Compares (2004), Voicemail (2009), and Send Some Rain (2013). To listen to and purchase our most recent album, visit&amp;nbsp;http://fcsberkeley.bandcamp.com/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interested in gigs, purchasing a CD, or have general questions?

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Foresight Pre-Optometry Club is a student-run organization that seeks to unite UC Berkeley students and individuals around the area who are interested in pursuing a career in the field of optometry.

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Berkeley chapter of Phi Beta Lambda revolves around two central tenets: the promotion of the skills necessary for success in business leadership and the opportunity to experience the benefits of small club that some feel lacks at a large university such as UC Berkeley. In order to achieve these goals, Berkeley Phi Beta Lambda employs a committee system that is headed by an executive board. Each semester, nine different committees focus on completing various tasks for the education and enrichment of the members of the organization. All committees utilize different talents that have real-life applicability. From fundraising campaigns conducted by the Finance Committee to large-scale presentations hosted by the Historian committee, all members of Berkeley Phi Beta Lambda are exposed to and instilled with critical skills and knowledge that possess value during and after college life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkeley Phi Beta Lambda is affiliated with the national organization Future Business Leaders of America Phi Beta Lambda, Inc., a nonprofit organization. Because of this connection, Berkeley Phi Beta Lambda participates in various national-level and state-level functions hosted by FBLA-PBL, such as the State Business Leadership Conference held every spring. The State Representative on the executive board acts as the liaison between the local and state and national chapters of Phi Beta Lambda. Thus, Berkeley Phi Beta Lambda affords members the opportunity to interact with those not just on the Berkeley campus but also with affiliates at the state and national levels.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The UC Berkeley chapter of Hindu Students Council was founded in 1997 as a small organization of like-minded individuals with a keen interest in Hinduism. After a semester-long hiatus in 2000, the organization was revitalized with new leadership. Since then HSC has become a well-established club on campus, celebrating major festivals such as Dev-Diwali, Mahashivaratri, Makar Shankrati, Ramanavmi, providing the only open forum for Hindu students and faculty to organize on campus, and playing an active role in interfaith dialogue alongside a wide range of cultural and religious organizations.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mission Statement:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish Student Union works towards evaluating and improving Jewish life on campus while creating a unified structure to represent the Jewish community. We are here to express a voice, to allocate resources to members, and to foster communication between the leadership of student groups within Berkeley Hillel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Participation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JSU functions best when community members involve themselves in the everyday workings of the group, rather than relying solely on the leadership. The executive board exists to implement the desires of the community and we need external input to represent the Jewish Community effectively. If you have an idea for an event or program that you would like to see, email the JSU President Daphna Torbati, JSUPres@gmail.com.&lt;/p&gt;

Through our common heritage, we promote a balanced fellowship through which our peers may project one voice in celebration of our unique culture. We strive to foster an environment for cultural enrichment as we seek to remind students of their heritage, and to share with others what makes us a community. We hope that through our efforts, the organization may inspire and instill pride and devotion towards our Korean heritage with the student population and the community as a whole.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Status>Active</Status>
      <ShortName>MV</ShortName>
      <Summary>The Movement is UC Berkeley's premiere dance groups featuring different styles of hip-hop, jazz, and swing. With over 100 members, The Movement maintains a large but close family environment that is supportive to each member and our passions for dance.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Caroline Kim and Trisha Mitra founded the Movement in fall of 1999. They began with a vision of bringing together a diverse group of people sharing a passion to dance. Beginning with only 20 members, the group has expanded to over 100 members introducing different styles of hip-hop, jazz, and swing to the UC Berkeley campus. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Making their debut on Upper Sproul, the Movement continued to perform on Lower Sproul, cultural diversity fairs, various student productions on campus, the YWCA, and showscases at the Julia Morgan Theater. The Movement's continued success may account for why both Movement's Fall and Spring Showcases have sold out for the past three years! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Yet even as the group continues to grow, The Movement still works toward maintaining a close, family environment that is supportive to each member.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;The Pre-Pharmacy Informational Learning and Leadership Society (PILLS) is dedicated to assisting students interested in the field of pharmacy. As the main pre-pharmacy organization on campus, PILLS was founded in response to the lack of support and resources available to students interested in pursuing a degree in pharmacy. PILLS was established in order to provide Cal Students with the information and support needed in order to pursue pharmacy as a career path and to apply to pharmacy school. PILLS has created a variety of programs aimed at educating our fellow Cal students about the field of pharmacy. Our goal is to provide information about pharmacy and related fields, as well as opportunities to explore the field, and to guide students through the transition from UC Berkeley to pharmacy school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PILLS is not exclusively for pre-pharmacy students. All students regardless of if they are planning to attend pharmacy school or if they are still undecided about the field, are welcome at all events.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more information about the Academic Opportunity Fund:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Academic Opportunity Fund&lt;/strong&gt; awards grants for academic travel that enhances student access to valuable educational experiences beyond the classroom. The program provides opportunities for individuals and student groups to represent and further UC Berkeley's academic prestige and dedication to education. While most ASUC funding is restricted to on-campus activities, the Academic Opportunity Fund subsidizes off-campus academic pursuits - professional meetings, research conferences, academic competitions, and independent research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applications are accepted on a rolling basis by the ASUC Academic Affairs Office. Allocations are generally limited to $500 per event, though this amount may be waived under exceptional circumstances. Since all graduate and professional student fees are directed to the Graduate Assembly, undergraduates will have the highest priority for this fund, though we do encourage all students to apply. Individuals who have not received funding in the past will be given greater consideration. Applicants that have the support and guidance of a UC Berkeley faculty mentor will receive special attention. Awards are contingent upon the availability of current funds and the number of received applications.&amp;nbsp; Each applicant may not apply for more than one grant for the same event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Committee will give the highest priority to proposals that demonstrate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more information about the Public Service Fund:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Public Service Fund&lt;/strong&gt; provides monetary support to increase and facilitate public service efforts targeted towards communities outside of the UC Berkeley campus. The objective of the program is to encourage students to partake in philanthropic or humanitarian based projects. The Public Service Fund strives to develop a sense of community awareness and enrich students&amp;rsquo; community service experiences. Funding is allocated based on the impact the activities/events have on the targeted communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Allocations are limited to $&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;500&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; per application for undergraduates and $250 per application for graduate students. Also t&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;he soft cap for travel fee is $175&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;per application.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Graduate and professional students should also contact the Graduate Assembly for grants specifically tailored to them. Individuals who have not received funding in the past will be given greater consideration.&amp;nbsp; Applicants that have the support and guidance of a UC Berkeley faculty mentor will receive special attention.&amp;nbsp; It is suggested that a letter of recommendation be attached, but it is not required. Awards are contingent upon the availability of current funds and the number of received applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT NOTES:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Limit is just a limit. This does not mean that you are likely to get $500 for just applying. Any ambiguity in the correlation between the proposed budget and amount requested will &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;DIRECTLY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; impact&amp;nbsp;the decision made by the allocation committee. Please try to be as &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPECIFIC AND REASONABLE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;as possible with the budget and the amount requested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***Please keep in mind that even though you may qualify for our specific grant, this does not guarantee an award. Should you have further questions, please feel free to contact us.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more information about the Educational Enhancement Fund:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Educational Enhancement Fund&lt;/strong&gt; provides monetary support to DeCal courses and independent student-initiated courses at UC Berkeley. The objective of the program is to increase diversity and address the unmet academic needs of the student body. Funding is allocated to applicants based on their proposed classroom curriculum and ability to achieve the EEF goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee will give the highest priority to proposals that demonstrate ability to achieve the EEF goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fulfill an academic need of the student body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the quality of instruction and learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create sustainable learning environment that is applicable to a wide audience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exhibit and foster continued devotion and passion by the applicant/instructor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate efforts to reduce costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Student instructors and course-coordinators are allowed to apply for a grant for up to $300. Since all graduate and professional student fees are directed to the Graduate Assembly, undergraduates will have the highest priority for this fund. You can only apply for one ASUC grant per event/class.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>The purpose of the Alternative Breaks Publication Group is to compile, design, print, and distribute Alternative Breaks Portfolios in order to document the meaningful service and reflection that occurs on Alternative Winter and Spring Breaks.  </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p class="x_rteleft" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.5em; padding: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="x_Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"&gt;Since its founding in 2001, Alternative Breaks has been a service-learning program that offers students opportunities to connect to the greater community through meaningful service, education, and reflection during their academic breaks. Many participants return from their experiences with greater insight on a particular social justice issue and a deeper understanding on what it means to get involved in the community. This year, Alternative Breaks offers ten trips to different&amp;nbsp;locations during the spring break, covering issues such as environmental justice, health care, immigration, and homelessness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Cal Camp has a history that dates back to the 1940s when students of UC Berkeley decided to create an organization that would enable underprivileged kids to be mentored and taught in a fun atmosphere. Thus, Cal Camp members set out to create an overnight camp experience where kids from less fortunate backgrounds could learn from college students in a peaceful and natural setting. Since then, Cal Camp has continued to employ men and women of the UC Berkeley campus dedicated to the bettering of children&amp;rsquo;s lives. Each year Cal Camp selected about 70 to 100 abused and fostered youths, age 7-14, from Alameda and Contra Costa counties for a weeklong overnight camping adventure. The youths play games, participate in team sports and attend seminars on topics pertinent to their daily lives.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, Cal Camp is more than fun and games. As Directors, we cannot stress enough about what Cal Camp means to the youth we serve.&amp;nbsp; Cal Camp is a vehicle to make change in the lives of the youth who attend and will be implemented as such.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>Ever since CALPIRG was founded in 1976 as one of the first Public Interest Research Groups in the country, we as students have stood up for the public interest whenever special interests get in the way of positive change.  </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;CALPIRG IS non-partican, and WE work on issues that are majoritarian, winning the support of at least 80% of students.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of CALPIRG&amp;rsquo;s biggest recent accomplishments include banning plastic bags in Alameda County, registering over 8,000 students to vote, advocating for cheaper textbooks, creating a website that allows students to rate their landlords, and educating thousands of kids in the bay area about energy efficiency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, we are tackling Global Warming with our Million Clean Cars campaign, Reclaiming Democracy by getting money out of politics, banning Fracking and Plastic Bags across California, educating the public about what they can do to cut down their energy bill, and reducing hunger and homelessness in Berkeley. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>The DeCal Program (or just DeCal) is a student-run democratic education program at the University of California, Berkeley - here, students create and facilitate their own classes on a variety of (often unorthodox) subjects.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The DeCal Program&lt;/strong&gt; (or just &lt;strong&gt;DeCal&lt;/strong&gt;) is a student-run democratic education program at the University of California, Berkeley - here, students create and facilitate their own classes on a variety of (often unorthodox) subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each semester we support over 150 courses facilitated by students, for students, on topics ranging from Taiwanese Language to Simpsons and Philosophy. These are accredited Pass / No Pass courses on our campus. To facilitate a course, a student must find a faculty sponsor. For example, a student wishing to facilitate a course on a favorite book can find an English professor to sponsor the course (as English 98/198 on student transcripts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 3000-4000 UC Berkeley students take DeCals each semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the &lt;strong&gt;DeCal Board&lt;/strong&gt; does:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage the online course listing / this website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help facilitators get funding from the ASUC, get publicity, make copies for their course, or simply help them fill out the paperwork.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put on pedagogical workshops, connect people to UC FTR resources, foster an academic dialogue on education.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every member of the DeCal Board holds office hours, at least 2 per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can contact anyone on the Board via email or phone:&lt;/p&gt;

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Established in 1992 at the University of California, Berkeley (founded nationally in 1987 at Chico State University), Gamma Zeta Alpha Fraternity, Inc. is a Latino interest fraternity dedicated to three principles: Academic Excellence, Community Service, and the maintenance of the Latino culture through Brotherhood. All brothers of this fraternity strongly abide by these values in their everyday lives and demonstrate this strength through performing a number of community building activities. Community service is perhaps one of our largest emphases, as we strive to return a small portion of what our families and upbringings have provided to us in our quest for success. The strong bond that we possess among our 21 chapters statewide makes the brotherhood experience unlike any other Greek organization on campus.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>HMAP, an entirely student-run organization, is the umbrella program for three programs that influence over a thousand students every semester: the class Public Health 116 (PH116), the Field Study Internship (FSI), and the Health Service Internship (HSI).</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;HMAP was created in 1984 by four UC Berkeley undergraduates with the goal to introduce Berkeley students to ethical issues and philosophical dilemmas related to the fields of health and medicine. The results of their efforts are three subprograms: the class Public Health 116 (PH116), the Field Study Internship (FSI), and the Health Service Internship (HSI).&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;An entirely student-run organization, HMAP continues to expose students to a broad spectrum of experiences and opportunities, covering many facets of health and medicine while emphasizing participatory learning.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;La Voz de Berkeley strives to voice the opinions, findings, and theories of those underrepresented by mainstream media. We want to address issues that affect our community, other people of color, and traditionally disenfranchised groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Xican@/Latin@ students, we take the responsibility of questioning and challenging unfounded images that permeate mainstream media within and beyond campus. La Voz de Berkeley aims to provide an open space for expression and discussion about the social, cultural, economic, and political forces that affect our lives. &amp;iexcl;La Voz es tu voz!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Articles and images featured in our publication cover politics, art, and culture that reflect the diverse opinions of our own writers and artists. To help reach the extended community, we translate several articles that we believe are most relevant to our Spanish-speaking community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net Impact is an international nonprofit organization with a mission to inspire, educate, and equip individuals to use the power of business to create a more socially and environmentally sustainable world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NIB is the Undergraduate chapter of Net Impact. We are your link to a network of over 30,000 students and professionals, each of whom are interested in making a positive impact on the world. Our goal is to provide members with the real world experience and connections needed to excel and change the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are sponsored by the ASUC, Haas School of Business, and the Center for Responsible Business. In addition, we work closely with other local Net Impact chapters (e.g., MBA at Haas, Professional at San Francisco, and other nearby universities) to provide our members with solid experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, NIB has four committees: Consulting, Marketing, Finance, and Internal Affairs. Each committee actively trains its associates so that our alumni are well-versed in each field. Our Consulting and Marketing Committees have their own process through which associates learn to strategize and develop successful campaigns. Our Finance Committee manages key relationships with corporations, and conducts on-site visits to learn more about the fast-paced world of finance. In Internal Affairs, associates learn how to plan events of various scales, as well as how to manage organizations. Please open the Committees tab to learn more about each committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general member, you will be able to attend all of our events, including many that are members-only. These events will prepare you to excel through networking and professional development. In addition, our general members are welcome to attend trainings hosted by any of our four committees.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Summary>Student Human Resources Association is the only group related to HR. Meet Professor Banks, Haas professor and expert in the field. Learn more about human resources, grow your skills, share your resume, and interact with professionals on a personal level.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Student Human Resources Association is an organization on campus that focuses on the professional field of Human Resourc&lt;/span&gt;es. Since there are only two courses on campus that address human resources or industrial psychology, our organization allows students to learn more about the field.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="x_x_x_text_exposed_show"&gt;&lt;br /&gt; * We offer opportunities for practical application of networking skills leading up to our networking event in the form of resume workshops, mock interviews, etc.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; * Membership with our organization will also get you membership into the Northern California Human Resources Association (NCHRA), which has job boards and HR training for certification among its resources. We also get discounted or free access to some of their conferences, which normally would cost $100+.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; * We hold a semesterly Networking Luncheon where students and professionals are able to network in a more intimate setting than the typical career fair. Each professional receives a resume book with all of the attendees' resumes and many connections resulting in internships or full time employment were made here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; SHRA is proud to announce our partnership with NCHRA (Northern California Human Resources Association), the second largest HR association in the nation. With an NCHRA-student membership, you will have access to job boards, networking events, seminars, workshops, and an HR West subscription, as well as the opportunity to network with thousands of HR professionals across northern California&lt;/div&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;SOGA! Student Organic Gardening Association&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Is a kale-chewing-garden-loving student association that manages the UCB Student Organic Garden on the corner of Walnut and Virginia. The association provides information and resources for students interested in organic gardening, horticulture, experimental education and food justice. We sponsor a DeCal class in the Spring which teaches college students basic organic garden skills and inspires students to become intimately engaged with their food from soil to table. Students experience this 8 week class with the expectation to learn how to plan, plant and care for their own garden using organic practices.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>We are a diverse group of students, faculty, staff, and community members at UC Berkeley, organized to promote justice, human rights, liberation and self-determination for the Palestinian people.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;We are a group of students, faculty, and community members working together at the University of California, Berkeley, in solidarity with the struggle of the indigenous Palestinian people against apartheid and occupation. In addition to organizing protests, memorials, and other events that attempt to visualize the Palestinian struggle, we organize frequent educational events that give a voice to the Palestinian narrative as well as highlight the plight of the Palestinian people under Israeli aggression.﻿&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are often asked what our vision for the future of Palestine and Israel is, as if we are entitled to decide on the precise shape and form of this future on behalf of those thousands of miles away. This question is a misunderstanding of our organization. We work in solidarity with, not on behalf of, Palestinians and Israelis who together continue to struggle against the apartheid regime that has consolidated itself in the West Bank, Gaza, Jerusalem, and 1967 Israel. It is not within our rights, then, to decide ourselves what that solution is, only to amplify those voices working against injustice. We like to say, though, that the future we would like to see in Palestine and Israel, we very much see already in ourselves: a diverse group of all backgrounds, Arab, Jewish, Palestinian, Israeli, and many others, coming together not based on our religious or ethnic identities, but rather in our agreement that we are working for a just cause.﻿&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

Through our events we strive to provide an environment where students from different ethnic backgrounds can come together to appreciate and learn from each other. There are many Taiwanese students in U.C. Berkeley who have just come to the U.S., and it is also one of our main objectives to provide guidance and resources for these students to adapt well to college life here.&lt;/p&gt;

TAC is a social and casual club that encourages members to not only better their tennis game but to meet others that share the same passion for tennis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;TAC provides its members with experiences, lessons, and memories that will last a lifetime!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are an intra-mural club comprised of players of all skill levels. During practices, members are asked to join their respective Division and play with those of similar skill levels. Placement into a division is generally decided by the player's own discretion, but the officers can assist members find the right group to be in. Divisions are comprised from D1 (experienced) to D4 (beginner). We welcome all players, whether they have not played tennis before, or they have played for several years and competed in tournaments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practices and drill sessions are always optional. Join us whenever you can!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also hold tournaments and socials outside of our regular practice times. Tournaments are typically held three times a semester (1 Singles, 1 Doubles, and 1 World Team Tennis tournament). All members of TAC are welcome to participate! Socials include: rock climbing, boba socials, Six Flags, bowling, and more! These will be announced on our webpage and at practices a few weeks before the the event.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fall 2013 Practice Schedule (starting on 9/16):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mondays, 7-9 p.m.&lt;br /&gt; Thursdays, 5-7 p.m.&lt;br /&gt; Saturdays, 2-4 p.m. /&amp;nbsp;4-5 p.m. Drills Session (D3/D4 Only)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Come early to warm-up!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <Summary>Established in 2006, UC Berkeley TCA works to advocate for the preservation of Teo Chew and Chinese culture and to promote the general welfare of the Teo Chew community at Berkeley and abroad.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px; color: #000000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About UCB TCA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UC Berkeley Teo Chew Association started as a Facebook group, but it eventually grew to something much more. When some people realized that were actually quite a number of Teo Chew people in Berkeley, they decided that there should be a actual Teo Chew club on campus. Thus, in the fall semester of 2006, TCA was born. Our goal is to advocate for the preservation of Teo-Chew and Chinese culture and for the general welfare of the Teo-Chew community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are a club dedicated to preserving our Teo-Chew culture and building a strong community here at Cal. Throughout each semester, we hold exciting social and informative cultural events where students can meet other fellow Teo Chew students on campus (and of course, non-Teo Chew as well; we are not limited to only Teo-Chew people!). Our past events include: game nights, Teo-Chew cooking nights, Family History projects, and much more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Teo Chew People&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Our language is a derivative of the Min-Nan dialect of Chinese, of which Hokkien and Taiwanese (Fujian-hua) are closely related. We are famous for our powerful kung-fu tea, goochi (chive) gue dumplings, and magnificent vegetable carving.﻿﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 12px; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Theatre Rice, the first modern Asian American theater group at the University of California, Berkeley, was started in the fall of 1998. Since its conception, Theatre Rice has grown considerably, both artistically and physically. In the past several years, the group has begun to attract an increasingly larger audience and a greater membership. Theatre Rice has emerged from a relatively unknown group to a group whose performances have become an anticipated community event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theatre Rice was conceived to provide people (particularly, but not exclusively, Asian American) who might not otherwise have a chance to participate in theatrical arts the opportunity to act, write, sing, direct, dance, and learn behind-the-stage techniques. What sets Theatre Rice apart from other dramatic groups is its open and unintimidating environment, and the basic ethic that effort and commitment are more important than experience or innate talent. Because the group is comprised of both seasoned and fledgling actors, there exists a healthy dynamic within which members can share their experiences and learn from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Asian American aspect of Theatre Rice is important because it is a step towards combating the misrepresentation, as well as the lack of representation, of the Asian American community in popular culture. By its mere existence, Theatre Rice is fulfilling its purpose of putting forth ideas that stem from the minds of Asian Americans, and therefore addressing the Asian American population as well as the greater community within Berkeley and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Status>Active</Status>

      <Summary>The Cal Vietnamese Student Association strives to empower its members to become leaders of their communities and preserve the history and heritage of the Vietnamese culture for future generations. We welcome any and all to come join our family!</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;h4&gt;Our Founding&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longing for their homeland, a group of immigrant Vietnamese students at UC Berkeley joined forces and created the Vietnamese Student Association in 1979.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their goal was to create a space in which they could connect through their similar backgrounds and share their culture with each other. To further their purpose, they looked to educate others about Vietnamese culture, history, and heritage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through their efforts they built a family away from home for Vietnamese and Vietnamese American students, a community that continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cal VSA Today&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Cal VSA is still a student organization that embraces our Vietnamese and Vietnamese American roots and culture. Though our members are a part of a new generation, we recognize and commemorate the experiences that our parents and relatives have had while also striving to identify and to understand the emerging narratives and current issues in our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cal VSA, alongside our goals, has evolved as an organization but we are still driven by the same principles that our founders embraced. These principles can be summed up by our three pillars:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Academics&lt;/strong&gt; | We recognize and embrace the opportunities that we have been given and we endeavor to extend the same opportunities to others in our community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community&lt;/strong&gt; | We recognize the diverse contemporary issues facing our community and we attempt to understand them, to promote awareness about them, and to address them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Culture&lt;/strong&gt; | We recognize that we have a unique Vietnamese heritage and tradition and we aim to preserve and to learn more about our culture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though we are an organization that focuses on the Vietnamese American experience, we are honored to be able to count many members of non-Vietnamese heritage as part of our family. &lt;strong&gt;We welcome any and all students to come see what Cal VSA has to offer!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

&lt;p&gt;As its primary mission, FIMRC establishes and maintains pediatric medical clinics in underserved regions. This includes staffing the clinic with local physicians and nurses; hosting international volunteers at its clinic sites; and raising funds for medical equipment and supplies. FIMRC also supports existing medical facilities with funding and volunteer staffing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FIMRC at Berkeley strives to accomplish those goals in a way that pertains to us, that is, by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fundraising for the construction of pediatric clinics in areas currently lacking a reliable source for healthcare.&lt;/li&gt;

      <Summary>Global Medical Training is an international, non-profit, and humanitarian organization focused towards addressing the healthcare needs of developing countries in Latin America through providing free medical and dental care services.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Global Medical Training (GMT) is an organization that is focused entirely around our motto "LEARN BY DOING." It gives students the unique chance to participate in a more "hands-on" diagnoses and treatments of patients in Latin America under the supervision and training given by medical professionals. In the process, students will not only have time to learn more about health related professions for their near future, but also be socially aware and culturally competent in order to aid other medical deprived nations. UC Berkeley students will be given a chance to expand their understanding of medicine as well as health related hardships of living in third world countries whilst increasing awareness of the lack of healthcare in such &amp;nbsp;countries and providing care, information for the betterment of the nation. GMT services are also not limited to our national partners but are provided to our community as well. We will offer our students the opportunity to volunteer in multiple service events focused towards serving the underprivileged community of Berkeley and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;On December 1, 1975, history was made &amp;ndash; history on a college campus, which would transcend other colleges/universities throughout the United States; history which would have a positive impact on the Latino community and our nation; history which would forever change the Greek system, more specifically, the entity known as a fraternity. On December 1, 1975, Lambda Theta Phi was founded on the campu&lt;span class="x_x_text_exposed_show"&gt;s of Kean College in Union, New Jersey.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The ideals of this brotherhood are the following: Academic Excellence; Brotherhood; Leadership; Latino Unity; Service. On a daily basis, our brothers live up to these ideals, as set forth by fourteen young Latino men decades ago.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Since our founding, Lambda Theta Phi has established chapters in every region of the country at both the undergraduate and professional levels. Our brotherhood continues to provide the necessary skills and resources for the advancement and empowerment of our people and for the betterment of this nation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The University of California, Berkeley was home to the newest chapter of Lambda Theta Phi, Latin Fraternity, Inc. in the Spring semester of 2004. Ten undergraduate students came together with the idea of introducing a positive image of a Latino fraternity to the UC Berkeley campus. They wanted to embrace and take part in the unity, brotherhood, pride and respect for all cultures that Lambda Theta Phi offered.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On May 9, 2004, Luis Sanchez, Renato Manay, Renzo Manay, Arquimides Pacheco, and Rafael Hernandez created a historical landmark and established the first Latino Greek Letter Fraternity officially recognized by the National Interfraternal Council (NIC) on the UC Berkeley campus.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Now, since its establishment and through its further development and growth, Lambda Theta Phi in UC Berkeley has continued to carry through its ideals of a service/social fraternity by giving back to the community while engaging in social activities that would allow further bondages among our members and with other organizations. Such include our participation in the Annual AIDS Walk, our service in low-income Oakland Elementary schools, and advocacy of immigrant rights to day laborers within the county of Alameda. Apart from these community service events, this chapter has sought to create strong ties and mutual respect with other Latin and non-Latin organizations through social activities and collaborative efforts.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Lastly, the main goal of Lambda Theta Phi in UC Berkeley is to pursue the educational success of our fraternity brothers. At the national level, from New Jersey to California, many go on to become doctors, lawyers, engineers, among other professionals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the Queer Straight Alliance is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; a) To create a safe and inclusive environment at UC Berkeley for students to support each other and to learn about various forms of oppression such as but is not limited to: homophobia, sexism, racism, transphobia, ablism, and classism and to learn ways and skills to fight such oppressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; b) To educate and raise public awareness about diverse issues surrounding the LGBTQQIA and Berkeley community through multiple perspectives. Some of these issues will include topics such as homophobia, gender identity, sexual orientation, queer people of color, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; c) To fight discrimination, harassment, and violence on campus through educational workshops, caucuses, and other public events promoting equity and unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; d) To reach out to those out side of UC Berkeley by welcoming other community members to participate in certain events and holding state/nation-wide workshops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through these functions, QSA hopes to further grow as a community leader and to empower others. Members of the QSA will work together and reach out to other organizations/clubs on and off campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QSA strives to provide a &amp;ldquo;safe space&amp;rdquo; where every individual can be free of harassment, discrimination, isolation, judgment, and/or violence that occur because of who they are. We will achieve these results by empowering and motivating students and student/community leaders to end inequalities that exist at Cal and in our society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, QSA strives to create an accepting and united community.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Status>Active</Status>
      <ShortName>REACH</ShortName>
      <Summary>"Committed to the service, empowerment, and mobilization of immigrant, refugee, and under served Asian/Pacific Islanders by promoting higher education to empower ourselves and challenge the economic and social inequalities facing our communities." </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;In 1994, REACH! began with a handful of committed folks, as a program under the Asian Student Union (ASU) at UC Berkeley to target &amp;ldquo;Asian Pacific American, high school students, especially those who are underrepresented, low-income, and non-college tracked&amp;rdquo;. Its goals were two-fold: 1) promoting higher education as an attainable goal and 2) empowering students through &amp;ldquo;building ethnic pride and programs that foster community activism and support APA youth culture&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As REACH! grew organizationally, the vision and purpose of REACH! grew with it. While the mission remained, &amp;ldquo;the service and empowerment of recent immigrant and urban Asian Pacific Americans living in at-risk life situations,&amp;rdquo; we added on that &amp;ldquo;Our goal is to promote higher education as a means to empower ourselves and improve the economic and social conditions facing our communities.&amp;rdquo; We saw that REACH! had a unique role on campus and in the API community at large, because REACH! was not just going to increase the numbers of underrepresented Asians at Berkeley but REACH! would be a training ground for future educators, activists, and leaders who would address society&amp;rsquo;s injustices through their life&amp;rsquo;s work. Thus, we created programs to raise political awareness, build coalitions, develop youth leaders, and build leadership in ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each year, programs have been refined and recreated by (insanely) dedicated and intelligent coordinators, who look for a better way to do things. However, our single most important legacy is the steady stream of community leaders we have and will produce.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Originally founded in 2006, Remedy Music Project is UC Berkeley's premier, student-run, concert production group that aims to feature not big-name artists, but artists who are students just like you. Our goals are twofold: (1) provide student artists the opportunity to share their work and (2) use the campus' musical talent to promote awareness of important community issues. We believe that each individualal's perception of the world is only a small fraction of what the world truly is; this often times prevents each one of us from being able to recognize the unfortunate realities that exist in the world. We believe that by using the power of music, we can help inspire people to create and become remedies for these realities and build communities of people who are motivated by and work for similar passions.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>Sponsored by the world's oldest service organization Rotary International, Rotaract is a service club for those interested in humanitarian service, networking, building goodwill, and promoting peace around the world.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;h5 style="font: normal normal normal 1.9em/normal Georgia,'Times New Roman'; color: #3c78a7; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"&gt;What is Rotaract?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"&gt;Sponsored by international service organization Rotary International, Rotaract is a service club for young men and women ages 18-30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"&gt;Modeled after similar goals and standards to those of Rotary, Rotaract brings together college students and young business professionals for the purpose of humanitarian service, networking, building goodwill and promoting peace around the world. As one of the fastest-growing Rotary programs, Rotaract on the international scale includes more than 8,000 Rotaract clubs in some 155 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"&gt;Each individual Rotaract club is sponsored by a local Rotary club, and is generally either university- or community-based. Each chapter has its own unique personality, sometimes with special emphases and focuses dependent upon the array of members and their particular interests. Like Rotary, Rotaract clubs meet on a regular basis, and are nonpolitical, nonreligious and open to anyone interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"&gt;Rotaractors address many of global and local issues pertinent to today&amp;rsquo;s society, developing projects that promote service, build friendship and provide a forum for cultural exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 style="font: normal normal normal 1.9em/normal Georgia,'Times New Roman'; color: #3c78a7; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"&gt;Why Join Rotaract?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 30px; list-style-type: square; list-style-position: initial; padding: 0px;"&gt;&lt;strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"&gt;Service opportunities:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;The main focus of Rotaract is humanitarian service on all fronts&amp;ndash;locally, nationally and internationally. UC Berkeley offers a variety of community service opportunities several times a month, many of which are local. Additionally, transportation is always arranged for members, so members can always get to events regardless of distance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 30px; list-style-type: square; list-style-position: initial; padding: 0px;"&gt;&lt;strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"&gt;Networking:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Networking is key to any profession, so what better way to make connections than in a club that gives you direct access to Rotarians, all of whom are professionals at the top of their field, both undergraduate and graduate students in a variety of majors and fields of study, and young business professionals?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 30px; list-style-type: square; list-style-position: initial; padding: 0px;"&gt;&lt;strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"&gt;Awards &amp;amp; Scholarships:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Rotaract will give you the inside on Rotary-related scholarship opportunities as they come along, including those that have specific scholarships set aside for Rotaractors. These include the extremely prestigious Rotary Ambassadorial Scholarship, The Scholar Ship and International RYLA (Rotary Youth Leadership Awards).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 30px; list-style-type: square; list-style-position: initial; padding: 0px;"&gt;&lt;strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"&gt;International connections:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;One of the key benefits of Cal Rotaract is our affiliation with Rotary International, an influential community service organization that has clubs all over the world.&lt;/li&gt;

      <Description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sigma Pi Alpha is a Chicana/Latina Sorority. It was founded in the Spring of 1996 at the University of California at Berkeley by nine women who saw the need to create a close network of Chicana/Latinas - Chicana/Latinas who want to make a difference in the community starting with themselves. Sigma Pi Alpha addresses the academic, cultural, communal, and social needs of its members.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;For ourselves we are a sisterhood of academic and personal support, trust, and understanding. We base our work on our three pillars of academics, service and sisterhood. We work on the basis of our pillars and follow our following seven goals:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. To enhance Chicana/Latina heritage within the sorority. 2. To be involved within campus and our communities. 3. To promote higher education in future generations. 4. To address academics, sisterhood, and personal and individual needs. 5. To create a sisterhood in which we can communicate and express ourselves with trust and security. 6. To form a sisterhood where we can receive support and a commitment that will last a lifetime. 7. To follow a code of conduct representative to us as a sorority and as Chicana/Latina women.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;For our campus we sponsor informative and social activities. We support our fellow RAZA organizations and network with other campus resources and groups. For our community our priority is to promote higher education through mentoring, tutoring, scholarships, and to support Chicana/Latina youth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Team HBV at UC Berkeley, along with other chapters across the U.S., is dedicated to raising awareness of the disproportionately high incidence of hepatitis B (HBV) and liver cancer among the Asian and Pacific Islander (API) community. ------- Did you know? * 1 in 10 (!!) Asian Americans are infected with Hepatitis B * 1/4 of those that have Hepatitis B will die from liver cancer * Berkeley requi&lt;span class="x_text_exposed_show"&gt;res us to get vaccinated for Hepatits B, however that just prevents us from contracting it from freshman year on * That means if you had it at birth, the vaccination does nothing for you * There are NO symptoms, until it is too late --------- SO, get screened (aka tested) and urge your parents and loved ones to do so as well! Please contact one of the officers if you are interested in joining us in our cause!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;"Eighteen Years Stong"&lt;br /&gt; For the past 18 years TRENZA has provided a support network for the many young women that have stepped foot on the UC Berkeley campus. Socials, parties, community events, and weekly meetings have allowed TRENZUDAS to share numerous precious memories with each other. Positive attitudes and warm smiles characterize the exemplary organization that is TRENZA. The women of this organization hold it very dear to their hearts as they reminisce. Remember the smiles, the hi's as you passed each other on Sproul, the laughs, the talks, the cries, the banda dancing, the cooking, the retreats, and those special moments that occurred when you chose to become a TRENZUDA.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;({}) V-Day at UC Berkeley ({}) is not only a group that puts on playwright Eve Ensler's &lt;em&gt;The Vagina Monologues&lt;/em&gt; every year to raise money to end violence against women, but we are a movement on campus and in our community.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Every fall, we assemble a cast and crew through auditions to form a community for strong, motivated students who have, do or will identify as a woman. This community becomes a place of strength where women empower each other, learn from each other and prepare themselves to become a vagina warrior.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Through alliances with other student groups and through the support of UC Berkeley's Gender Equity Resource Center and the ASUC, we strive to make this a learning experience not for those part of the movement but for all of those on campus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Every spring, as part of the culimination of our community and movement building, we bring our awareness and strength to the public through benefit performances of &lt;em&gt;The Vagina Monologues&lt;/em&gt; to raise money and awareness to stop violence against women.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>“Hi! We’re the Vounteer Health Interpreters Organization”

Better known as VHIO, we provide verbal interpretation and document translation for healthcare related services in the San Francisco Bay Area.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**FOR MORE INFO: &amp;lt;www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~vhio&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;also look &amp;lt;&lt;cite&gt;calhbc.wordpress.com/&amp;gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lrm; for past events&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VHIO strives to eliminate language barriers in healthcare settings by providing trained volunteer interpreters from UC Berkeley to healthcare organizations and facilities for underserved, limited English proficient (LEP) communities in the Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;VHIO is a University of California, Berkeley undergraduate student-led organization whose roots trace back to 2007, when it was established as the San Francisco Hepatitis B Collaborative (SFHBC) in partnership with University of California, San Francisco health professional students. SFHBC at Berkeley provided trained bilingual students as Asian language interpreters for two monthly UCSF hepatitis B student-run clinics, which we continue to volunteer at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dedicated to helping stop the spread of Hepatitis B, SFHBC partnered with organizations such as the San Francisco Hepatitis B Free Campaign and helped at various screening, vaccination, and education events. Four hundred million people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B infection, which tragically can lead to liver cancer early in adult life. It is the 10th leading etiologic cause of death in the world. Fortunately, the spread of the hepatitis B virus is preventable with a simple, safe, and effective vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to an increase in demand for interpretation services, we have been expanding to provide interpretation and volunteering services for a broader range of issues beyond hepatitis B. In August 2010, SFHBC at Berkeley was renamed the Volunteer Health Interpreters Organization (VHIO) to reflect its expanded scope of language capacities and its service base across the San Francisco Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Working closely together with UCSF medical and pharmacy students, health-workers and medical providers, &amp;nbsp;we are able to serve Mandarin, Cantonese, Korean, Vietnamese, Spanish, Tagalog and Khmer speaking patients to help them overcome the healthcare language barrier.&amp;nbsp;Each of our language groups have their own regular clinics established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outreach is a major part of our work. Since many health fairs aim to target underserved&amp;nbsp;populations, we help attain this goal by assisting immigrant neighborhoods with our interpretation services. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Stressing empowerment, VHIO is passionate about community education. Our volunteers have also interpreted for a number of presentations, ranging from colorectal cancer prevention to disaster preparedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;VHIO seeks committed volunteers who are fluent in a second language and passionate about outreaching to under-served communities. We recruit once a year at the beginning of the fall semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VHIO provides the following valuable experiences for pre-health students.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/strong&gt; Clinical Experience, working with underserved communities&lt;/p&gt;

      <Summary>Wonderworks members adopt an elementary school class for a semester and engage students in interactive science demonstrations. </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Wonderworks is a program stemming from one member's experience with a like minded project in high school. Wonderworks is not here to teach; that is already covered by teachers, and by many other organizations on the UC Berkeley campus. Using science as our tool of choice, our goal is to pique the interest of young students. This interest can be in the specific demonstration presented in the field of science, or in the whole idea of education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students volunteering their time to support Wonderworks would, in groups of 3-5, design or choose from existing GEM module presentations from the Lawrence Hall of Science. They would then adopt an elementary school class for a semester and perform interactive demonstrations during prearranged visits. These presentations usually occur about twice a month depending on outstanding factors, including the desires of the teacher of the class involved. Visits last about 2 hours; 1 hour for interactive demonstration and 1 hour of preparation and clean-up.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Status>Active</Status>
      <ShortName>OKA</ShortName>
      <Summary>OKA teaches an innovative school-based asthma education curriculum designed to help asthmatic children. As asthma instructors, we help school children manage their asthma so they spend more time in the classroom and less time in the emergency room.  </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000000;"&gt;Our goal is to provide our curriculum (Open Airways for Schools) to elementary and middle schools within our target area, the East Bay. Because asthma disproportionately affects lower income children, schools that serve these children will be given priority. The American Lung Association of the East Bay will provide trained college student instructors to teach the curriculum, supply all curriculum materials, and provide technical assistance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="color: #000000;"&gt;Oakland Kicks Asthma is an American Lung Association of California intervention program for indigent youth with asthma. Our program works closely with partners from the University of California at Berkeley School of Public Health, Oakland Unified School District, and Children's Hospital Oakland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;The East Bay Workers&amp;rsquo; Rights Clinic is a graduate student-run legal clinic that has served low-income individuals in the greater Bay Area with employment-related legal concerns for over a decade. Every Thursday, our organization holds a session to provide low-income workers around the Bay Area community with employment advice on a range of issues, including employment discrimination, unemployment, workers&amp;rsquo; compensation, wage and hour problems, and unreported overtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clinic begins at 5:30pm and often lasts past 10:00pm&amp;mdash;depending on when the last client leaves and the last legal question is addressed. Clinic meetings take place after-hours to best serve the working individuals who rely on the clinic&amp;rsquo;s services.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>We support women pursuing their graduate degrees in Mechanical, Nuclear, Industrial, Civil, Environmental, Chemical, Electrical and Bio Engineering.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;The Graduate Women of Engineering is a group of graduate engineering students from all engineering disciplines at the University of California, Berkeley. Our primary purpose is to support female graduate students in all their engineering endeavours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the year a number of informal events are held to allow women engineers (and those who support women in engineering) to welcome new students, network, share experiences, develop study groups, discuss issues and just socialize. We are always looking for new faces to join us and welcome any suggestions for new events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our events are advertised throughout the year via email and on the events page. If you are a women graduate student in ME, NE, IOER or BioE at UCB you should already be receiving our emails. If you want to be notified of our future events please sign up for the &lt;a href="https://calmail.berkeley.edu/manage/list/listinfo/gwe@lists.berkeley.edu" target="_blank"&gt; GWE mailing list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>The Iraqi Refugee Assistance Project at Berkeley Law School is part of a national organization that uses a combination of direct legal aid and broad policy advocacy to develop and enforce a system of legal and human rights for Iraqi and Afghan refugees.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;The Iraqi Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) at Berkeley Law School is part of a national organization of 22 law schools and 49 global law firms in the Middle East, Canada, and the United States. We use a combination of direct legal aid and broad policy advocacy to develop and enforce a system of legal and human rights for Iraqi and Afghan refugees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IRAP case teams take on urgent refugee cases that include: Iraqis and Afghans at risk of persecution because of their work as interpreters for the U.S. military; female survivors of sexual assault, domestic abuse, or human trafficking; and LGBT refugees. Law students are teamed up with attorney supervisors to provide free legal representation and services for the duration of the client&amp;rsquo;s resettlement application or appeals process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IRAP&amp;rsquo;s policy team works directly with IRAP National to lobby the U.S. Congress. Our projects this year include lobbying Congress to extend the Special Immigrant Visa program, expand refugee programs for Afghans, and create comprehensive policy for LGBT refugees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information, please contact May Whitaker, IRAP-Berkeley Chapter Director, or visit www.refugeerights.org&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

&lt;p&gt;What is art but simply a physical manifestation of grace and creativity sourced from the mind of its creator. Nothing is as immediate to an artist&amp;rsquo;s mind as the body itself. This direct relationship offers an absolute means of access to a medium possessed by all. Bodybuilding utilizes this relationship with the intent of creating a masterpiece unique to each artist capable of committing to the craft.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Status>Active</Status>
      <ShortName>BA</ShortName>
      <Summary>Board of Advocates consists of the Alternative Dispute Resolution, Appellate, and Mock Trial teams of U.C. Berkeley School of Law. BOA has won competition awards at multiple levels and consistently outperforms other top-ten law schools. </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;The Board of Advocate&amp;rsquo;s general membership includes over 60 students who participate in both regional and national competitions in three main areas: Alternative Dispute Resolution, Trial Advocacy, and Appellate Advocacy. Competition for a place on these teams is fierce during the Board&amp;rsquo;s yearly try-out process, with multiple students vying for each spot. Teams receive coaching from professors, Executive Board Members, alumni, and fellow students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board also places a strong emphasis on training fellow students and future members through internal competitions, offering scholarship money and the opportunity to be heard by federal judges in mock argument. The Board of Advocates provides further opportunities for students to hone their advocacy skills, hosting multiple skills workshops throughout the year. Finally, the Board organizes other annual events such as Ninth Circuit Day, which provides students a rare chance to see the federal court in action in an academic setting.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;The College Ski and Snowboard Club, commonly known as the CSSC, provides Cal students with the best, cheapest, and funnest way to get to the snow.&amp;nbsp;Our main event is our Big Trip, held during&amp;nbsp;the last week of winter vacation. Each year we travel to a different ski resort in the Western U.S. for a week of skiing at a price you cannot find anywhere else. During the spring semester, we host weekend trips to Tahoe. When we're not skiing, we hold parties, sales, and movie nights in Berkeley to get members excited before they even see the snow. Come visit us on Sproul, M-F from 11-2, for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're the kids in Berkeley who smile when it's raining . . .&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>Colleges Against Cancer: Relay for Life's purpose is to help eliminate cancer by supporting the programs of the American Cancer Society on college campuses. Students focus on four channels: advocacy, cancer education, Relay For Life, and survivorship</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Colleges Against Cancer: Relay for Life is a program created to help eliminate cancer by initiating and supporting the programs of the American Cancer Society on college campuses. It is a program designed by and administered by college students from across the country and is supported by the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program is designed to allow students and staff to work through many different channels to eliminate cancer. These channels are our strategic directions&amp;mdash;advocacy, cancer education, Relay For Life, and survivorship. Local chapters work alongside their local offices and national leadership to support the efforts of the American Cancer Society in these directions. Whether it is writing letters to Congressmen, organizing Relay For Life, or teaching students about preventing cancer, the program enables college students to battle cancer on their campuses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;The Entomology Students Organization (ESO) is hosted by the Department of Environmental Science Policy and Management, but represents approximately 30 graduate students from various departments, all with an interest in insects. ESO provides peer-academic support for the entomology community through hosting workshops and events. We hold monthly meetings on topics ranging from macro-photography, presentation and grant writing advice, insect education, as well as coordinating field trips and participating in public events such as Cal Day and Darwin Day. In addition, we co-host the Essig Brunch weekly seminar series, along with the &lt;a href="http://essig.berkeley.edu/"&gt;Essig Museum of Entomology.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STEP is focused on creating better informed science and technology policy through collaborations between scientists and policy-makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of our most pressing public policy issues have a strong science and technology component, such as developing clean sources of energy and using information technology to reduce medical errors and administrative costs in our healthcare system. However, elected officials often lack the technical expertise to make informed decisions on these issues, and scientists and engineers rarely engage in the political process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address these needs, STEP is helping students build interdisciplinary skills at the intersection of science and policy.&amp;nbsp;STEP works toward this goal through three activities: an annual White Paper Competition, a monthly Seminar Series and a Science Policy Journal Club.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Teach in Prison is a student run DeCal class that sends Cal student tutors to work with inmates at San Quentin Prison (SQ).&amp;nbsp; The primary tutoring groups work on phonics, proof-reading papers and grant proposals, counting and numbers, H.S. math, GED prep, and more.&amp;nbsp; We also have a team of mechanical engineering graduate students who teach computer aided design to inmates in San Quentin's machine shop.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, there is a weekly class room meeting where guest lectures from all facets of the prison system present lectures that help students understand topics like: how prisons operate; what sort of education a person gets in prison; what it&amp;rsquo;s like to be a prison guard; what prison programs are there beyond Cal to get involved with.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s a very unique and rewarding experience for many students, and the program is in it&amp;rsquo;s 12 year as a DeCal.&amp;nbsp; We also recently won the Campus Community Partnership Award.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crossroads Christian Fellowship is the college fellowship of Vinewood, the English ministry at Chinese for Christ (CFC) Church in Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are a student-led Christian fellowship on the Berkeley campus. We meet together on Friday nights at 7:30pm to worship, study the Word, and socialize with followers of Christ. We also offer weekly small groups to nurture personal spiritual growth in a more intimate setting. We are a ministry of Vinewood at Chinese for Christ Berkeley. &amp;nbsp;Our church is located two blocks past Ashby on Prince Street and College Avenue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our vision is to seek and raise up believers and to nurture a maturity amongst them that will transcend their college years. We foster leadership opportunities so that members of our fellowship can develop their spiritual gifts and grow to become dependent on God alone by being challenged by the Word. CFC Berkeley also sponsors a&amp;nbsp;young adult fellowship&amp;nbsp;that offers spiritual mentors for college students.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Summary>ES renamed from FSES per ASUC Senate Bill 133 10-31-12</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="x_x_x_x_x_x_Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 11px; color: #222222; line-height: 22px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;FSES, UC Berkeley's newest business club founded in 2010, was the result of an entrepreneurial passion shared by two friends and college entrepreneurs. &amp;nbsp;Arian Rezazadeh (Class of 2013) and Ethan Mark (Class of 2013) had a unique idea for the 2009 Cal vs. Stanford Big Game to help Cal fans show their team pride. &amp;nbsp;As Arian and Ethan always describe it, "It all started with a small idea for a big game, and it turned out to be a big idea for an even bigger game." Arian and Ethan designed Big Game t-shirt people went crazy for, marketed it on campus, and sold a significant quantity of them. But it didn't end there. This business venture that they created from scratch took a lot of time and work. This prompted them to seek a club on campus that could help them out, make the process easier, and allow them to have a support group. To their dismay, Arian and Ethan could not find any clubs on campus that could assist freshman and sophomore students in this, and so they co-founded FSES to meet the needs of this part of the student body. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Today, FSES has rapidly grown into a premier business club focused on a niche of meeting the needs of freshman and sophomore students at the University of California, Berkeley to develop their ideas and make them into full-on business ventures that can operate as stand-alone businesses. With a speaker series of successful entrepreneurs, case studies of entrepreneurial ideas, the 'Best Entrepreneurial Idea of the Semester' competition, and legal assistance team for start-ups, FSES is the club you want to be a part of. It's practical knowledge, a support group, and a place where you can make your ideas a reality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Status>Active</Status>
      <ShortName>SEEDS</ShortName>
      <Summary>The purpose of our group is to engage student of underrepresented groups in ecology through graduate-undergraduate mentorship, field trips, community outreach, and special events.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;SEEDS is a club with a lot of words in the name! But we've found ways to make it all work together. We are a Chapter of the national SEEDS program established by the Ecological Society of America. The ESA saw that diversity was lacking in the field of ecology, especially in the professional world.&amp;nbsp; They decided to address this by encouraging diversity amongst younger generations of ecologists in order to create a sustaining and lasting change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At UC Berkeley, we wanted to see those working on sustainability efforts to represent a more diverse background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;What we do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;We can hook you up with some opportunities to get a &lt;strong&gt; grad student mentor&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;If you're a grad, allow you to share your experiences with an undergrad and get their &lt;strong&gt;help with research&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;Get engaged in a some &lt;strong&gt;environmental action&lt;/strong&gt; going on in the vibrant city of Berkeley, and maybe even Oakland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

      <Summary>The UC Berkeley Singapore Malaysia Student Association is a support organization run by Singaporeans, Malaysians and students of other nationalities to provide a closely knit family for other Singaporeans and Malaysians studying at Cal. </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;We hold regular activities - some are purely for fun, some to help the freshmen out, and some to increase the school community's awareness of our organization. Notable events like freshmen BBQ, Chinese New Year dinner with neighboring Stanford University's SSA, Springfest and hiking trips are just some of the many things we do. Either way, we always enjoy ourselves thoroughly and in one another's company!&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>The Arts and Creativity Grant provides up to $500.00 for activities described at our home page.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applications for Spring 2011 have hereby ended. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;If you are not a member yet, click Join Organization. Once you are added as a member, you can go to Surveys &amp;amp; Forms to fill out the application.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**IMPT: You must login (top right of screen) with you calnet ID and passphrase in order to fill out an application!!**&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome and thank you for your interest in the Arts and Creativity Fund!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARTS AND CREATIVITY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt; FUND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arts and Creativity Fund provides financial assistance to students and student groups that seek to enhance the exposure of visual, performing, and creative art endeavors on campus. The objective of the program is to foster greater creativity through arts on campus.&amp;nbsp; Funding is allocated to students or groups that organize and widely advertise artistic events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applications are accepted on a rolling basis by the ASUC Academic Affairs Office.&amp;nbsp; All registered individuals and student groups are encouraged to apply for a grant up to $500 per event.&amp;nbsp; The Committee may waive this limit under compelling circumstances.&amp;nbsp; Since all graduate and professional student fees are directed to the Graduate Assembly, undergraduates will have the highest priority for this fund, though we do encourage all students to apply.&amp;nbsp; Applicants who have not received funding in the past will be given greater consideration.&amp;nbsp; Awards are contingent upon the availability of current funds and the number of received applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are 4 simple steps in applying for an ACF grant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Starting November 10, 2010 applications will be available on this website.&amp;nbsp; Log in with your user ID and passphrase on the top right corner,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;If you are not a member yet, click "Join Organization."&lt;/strong&gt; After you are added, click on the "surveys and forms" button the the right panel and fill out the application with relevant information.&amp;nbsp; Make sure every question is answered.&amp;nbsp; The more thorough and thoughtful your answers are, the better we understand the ideals of your event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Come to Eshelman Hall located on Lower Sproul.&amp;nbsp; Go to the second floor and sign up for an interview time in front of the AAVP Grants Office, room 205. &amp;nbsp;There will be a section specifically for MCF applicants so that they will be interviewed by someone involved in that particular fund. After you have signed up for the interview you will receive a confirmation email asking you to come back to 205 Eshelman at the time of the interview.&amp;nbsp; Interviews will be 15 minutes long. Only one representative of the applicant or applicant group should attend the interview.&amp;nbsp; Please come prepared to answer questions regarding the event details, including an itemized budget.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;nbsp;After the interview, wait for an email from us to inform you about your award.&amp;nbsp; This will approximately take 2 weeks after you interview. If you are awarded a grant, ASUC Grants will also send you an email inviting you to become a 1st Stage Financial Requestor. &amp;nbsp;You will need to accept this invitation in order to file an Expenditure Request Form (ERF) to be reimbursed after your event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;After your event, please fill out a Expenditure Request Form and submit it within TWO WEEKS of the completion of your&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <ShortName />
      <Summary>Bay Against Brain Cancer aims to find a cure for pediatric brain cancer. </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;We plan to accomplish this by raising money, garnering awareness, and influencing public policy to support cancer research. We raise money for a lab at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center that has a record of producing groundbreaking, life-saving technologies. &amp;nbsp;Bay Against Brain Cancer is unique in that we are focused on one specific type of cancer and one research lab. After losing a friend to a brain tumor at age 11, we are passionate about ending this disease. Brain cancer is the second most common cancer in children and is one of the most difficult cancers to operate on. The lab that we raise money for is close to our hearts, as the head researcher at the lab was also our late friends' attending physician.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>CSTC provides a platform for Chinese students interested in theatre performances. Our mission is to improve students’ physical coordination, teamwork skills, and creativeness and also to develop students’ perception of life through performances.</Summary>

In this way, our members can seek the implicit beauty of Chinese expressions and also get connected and feel like home through organization activities. Performances can become not only a vehicle of imparting our imagination and appreciation for Chinese expressions, but also a cultural legacy that will be inherited by future beings.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the SCADs Policy Group of Berkeley is to examine the proliferation of State Crimes Against Democracy (SCADs) in recent US political history, understand their policy ramifications, identify structural vulnerabilities in the policy process that enable SCADs to occur, and develop policy solutions to prevent SCADs in the future.&amp;nbsp; The objectives of the group will be pursued through a series of lectures, panels and colloquia involving visiting scholars and experts, as well as student-led seminars.&amp;nbsp; State Crimes Against Democracy can be defined as concerted actions by public officials intended to manipulate democratic processes and undermine popular sovereignty in pursuit of a specific policy objective.&amp;nbsp; SCADs differ from lesser forms of political criminality in their potential to alter or distort the direction or priorities of an entire government or government agency.&lt;/p&gt;

We also perform all over California at numerous events. We have made appearances at the Annual Big Sing-Off (UC Berkeley/Stanford), the California A Cappella Festival (UC Los Angeles), the West Coast A Cappella Showcase (UC Berkeley), and the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bezerkeley Constitution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated 3/20/2013&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mission:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bezerkeley is dedicated to the practice and evaluation of art as a catalyst for reflection and social change. Bezerkeley aims to allow students to provide themselves with the opportunity to use practice and evaluate art to change society and their lives.&amp;nbsp; We believe art can heal on the individual and societal level, a necessity to explore for expressing creative talent and discovering the world. Bezerkeley realizes the new age in art is handmade self-projects with local collaboration.&amp;nbsp; Celebrating the products and process of meaningful arts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article I &amp;ndash; Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact title for this group is Bezerkeley.&amp;nbsp; Some may refer to this group as Bezerkeley Art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article II &amp;ndash; Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this group is to practice and evaluate art as a catalyst for social reflection and change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article III &amp;ndash; Membership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to join Bezerkeley, one must have a passion to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only currently registered students, faculty, and staff may be active members in a registered student organization. Only active members may vote or hold office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will not haze according to California State Law.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will not restrict membership based upon race, color, national origin, religion, sex, physical and mental disability, medical condition (cancer-related or genetic characteristics), ancestry, marital status, age, sexual orientation, citizenship or status as a covered veteran (special disabled veteran, Vietnam-era veteran or any other veteran who served on active duty during a war or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While only current registered Berkeley students faculty and staff may be active members. Bezerkeley accepts does not discriminate those outside the Berkeley sphere and opens up official membership to all citizens and energy of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article IV &amp;ndash; Officers and Elections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-President: Miles Mathews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president works with all members of the organization to make decisions based on consensus.&amp;nbsp; Influential membership is not a right to the active member, rather a status that is won through trust and commitment. The influential members vote on the figurehead of the president.&amp;nbsp; There are no restrictions for how long someone can stay in office as president.&amp;nbsp; Elections come during the current semester before it is time to register for decals for the next semester.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-President: Calvin Li&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calvin Li shares the presidency with Miles Mathews as another figurehead of the organization. As figure heads, Bezerkeley and members look to the presidents for leadership and opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article V &amp;ndash; Meetings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meetings can occur at any time called by any member. Meetings are not mandatory, members know and choose when it is time to participate.&amp;nbsp; Due to Bezerkeley&amp;rsquo;s call to action nature, projects are often created the day of due to unique opportunities that arise. Sometimes a meeting is just a phone call between two or more members.&amp;nbsp; Large projects act as meetings and actions that involve the majority of the members.&amp;nbsp; Bezerkeley often hosts a decal class that acts as a meeting once a week as a trampoline for inspiration and reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article VI &amp;ndash; Constitutional Amendments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amendments to the constitution can be proposed by any member of the group and are voted on by every member of the group.&amp;nbsp; The proposition can pass with group consensus.&amp;nbsp; Amendments should be proposed in meetings and voted on in the next meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All amendments, additions or deletions to this document must be filed with the Center for Student Leadership in 102 Sproul Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All amendments, additions or deletions must be filed with the ASUC&amp;nbsp;Office of Student Affairs, 400 Eshleman Hall, within one week of adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article VII &amp;ndash; Dissolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any member of the group can call for dissolution if he feels it is in the best interest of the group to discontinue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All unspent ASUC&amp;nbsp;funds shall remain the property of the ASUC, all Graduate Assembly funds shall remain the property of the Graduate Assembly. Remaining privately-obtained funds may be donated to another nonprofit organization with prior approval of the ASUC&amp;nbsp;Senate Finance Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article VIII &amp;ndash; Activities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students in Bezerkeley are prompted to think of creative ideas for apparel and artwork.&amp;nbsp; Some of the ideas will be turned into silk-screened or spray-painted apparel or art.&amp;nbsp; This apparel/art will be sold on Sproul.&amp;nbsp; Some of the profit made from the sales of this clothing will go to fund the Bezerkeley Decal in which students will learn how to create custom shirts through spray paint and possibly screen-printing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>tbd</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Catholics at Cal is a student group extension of the larger community of the Newman Center/Newman Hall Holy Spirit Parish. It is the very purpose of Catholics at Cal to reach out to Cal Students and the spiritual needs necessary to, but not limited to, the spiritual life of Catholic students of Cal Berkeley. While one may be inclined to think that we serve a particular audience in campus, we are also very delighted to welcome those who want to get to know, or to revitalize oneself to the Catholic faith.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most student events hosted by the group are held at Newman Hall, events such as Seekers (weekly bible study group and fellowship) Rosary group, Yaggies (Graduate-student-and-beyond fellowship), LGBTQ fellowship, and weekly Student Dinner.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Name>Historical Fencing Club of Berkeley</Name>
      <Status>Active</Status>
      <ShortName>HFCB</ShortName>
      <Summary> The purpose of the Historical Fencing Club of Berkeley is to provide a study group for students of Classical and Historical fencing who are training in and/or researching any of the various forms of heritage/traditional or reconstructed Western </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the Historical Fencing Club of Berkeley is to provide a study group for students of Classical and Historical fencing who are training in and/or researching any of the various forms of heritage/traditional or reconstructed Western Martial Arts.&amp;nbsp; The group will give special attention to the pedagogy and practice of living lineages of traditional fencing as a basis for study.&amp;nbsp; The secondary goal of the group is to provide group members with a direct connection to the Classical fencing that existed in the early 20th and late 19th century in the Berkeley area.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, the Historical Fencing Club of Berkeley draws on the expertise of local and non-local Classical fencing masters and certified instructors as well as the support of dedicated students and scholars of Classical fencing and non-profit organizations such as the Association for Historical Fencing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meetings of this organization will help Classical fencers find ways to train the techniques and theory of Classical fencing but who may not have access to regular classes or training partners in Berkeley.&amp;nbsp; Having training partners is essential to fencing, because fencing, like any martial art, is a kinesthetic art that requires movement, sensibility, and interaction with other human beings much the way partner dance does.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Classical fencing is a rare traditional martial art that is not widely practiced.&amp;nbsp; Practicing Classical fencing will help to preserve its theory and philosophy and ensure its survival alongside more widely available and practiced modern styles of fencing (i.e. &amp;ldquo;sport&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Olympic&amp;rdquo; fencing) that have departed from the traditional way of thinking and practicing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes the Historical Fencing Club of Berkeley unique from other organizations is its focus on Classical theory in fencing, or fencing as a martial art, which treats training, bouting, academic assaults, etc. with the same respect and sincerity that good traditional fencing masters have always given to training for and participation in real combative encounters or duels.&amp;nbsp; This sort of training is contrasted with that of modern fencing which often trains to the rules of the sport or game of fencing as is defined by organizations such as the United States Fencing Association (USFA) and the Federation Internationale d&amp;rsquo;Escrime (FIE); the Historical Fencing Club of Berkeley recognizes &amp;ldquo;modern,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;sport,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Olympic,&amp;rdquo; and other synonymous styles of fencing training as inappropriate and dangerous in the context of martial arts training.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <Summary>The Human Journal is a publication on campus created to break down stereotypes by sharing stories. All the stories are personal, specific, and true, and they are published with the hope that reading them will make the Cal campus feel a little smaller. </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;The Human Journal builds communities on the Cal campus in two ways. The first, more obvious, way is through the publication. The publication is a collection of true, personal, and specific stories written by Berkeley affiliates (students, faculty, staff. . .) with the intention of letting us know each other a little better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second way that HJB builds community is through the staff. The staff of the Human Journal are a close knit group of individuals dedicated to making Cal a little bit friendlier and a little bit more welcoming. They know each other well, and support each other not just in journal related issues, but in life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

We also realize that there are many career and further education options available for MCB students, and we work to hold events that reveal more about these choices as well.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

&lt;pre&gt;ToxSA supports students in the Molecular Toxicology major and non-majors
interested in the field of toxicology by providing peer advising, career
preparation, and community service opportunities as well as exploring past
and current issues in toxicology.

Peer Advising-
Our peer advising services allow students in the same classes to get
together and form study groups as well as allow upper class-man to talk
with the lower class-man to direct and guide them through the courses at
Berkeley.

Community Service
A program sponsored by ToxSA called the Lead Education Awareness Program
(LEAP) allows students to become involved with toxicology related
community service. LEAP is a program that allows students to educate
children in low-income areas about the dangers from household hazards,
lead, and air pollution.

Career Prep-
Our career preparation services support students by touring the career
center, holding a resume writing workshop, and holding brown bag lunches
with the professors in the Molecular Toxicology department at Berkeley. 
Members of ToxSA also become members of the NorCal Society of Toxicology
(SOT).  This service has given students the opportunity to talk with real
life toxicologists in the field and learn what day to day life is like in
different toxicology fields.

ToxSA supports students not only through their years at Berkeley, but also
helps them for the future by exploring careers and networking&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

      <Summary>Supports the academic, professional and social development of students in, and interested in, the Integrative Biology major </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p class="x_x_x_normal"&gt;Despite the numerous biology student organizations on campus, there is no available forum for Integrative Biology students. Our organization hopes to strengthened the unity between students and professors within the large department as well as highlight the courses and opportunities offered from Integrative Biology department. However, even though this organization centers around the Integrative Biology major, it is opened to students of all majors with an interest in biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="x_x_x_normal"&gt;Moreover, other biology organizations focus on a specific aspect of biology, but the Department of Integrative Biology Students wants to educate and unite students who are interested in a holistic study of biology. Certain topics such as evolution, ecology, animal science, and much more are often not discussed by other existing biology clubs, but this organization will focus on highlighting these topics as well as topics in biology regarding human and health sciences, thereby creating and sharing an integrated approach to the field of biology.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>Feeding Forward connects those with excess food to those in need through technology. Our vision is to assure no one goes hungry, no food is wasted, and no one is denied the opportunity or assistance to become self-sufficient.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Feeding Forward (formerly known as BareAbundance) is built on grassroots action and community support; the project links volunteers directly to the Berkeley and Oakland communities. Essentially, we will distribute excess consumable foods from a network of local restaurants and cafes, farmer&amp;rsquo;s markets, UCB cooperative houses, Greek housing, local organic gardens, and small farms. This food will be afforded proper care by the Feeding Forward (formerly known as BareAbundance) team who will then redistribute the food to local shelters and low-income areas.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

We live it out, striving to be the church together: not only for believers and disciples, but also for our friends whose earnest and reasonable questions have gone too long unanswered in a culture jaded by religion but still intrigued by spirituality. We talk, eat, laugh, go out, study the bible, pray, study, share and more. We invite you to Klesis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Status>Active</Status>
      <ShortName>MED</ShortName>
      <Summary>We are dedicated to exploring the Middle Ages outside the Middle Ages. </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;From chess to Chaucer, the Crusades to the Vikings, and the parliament to the university, the legacy of the Middle Ages can be found almost everywhere in contemporary institutions and culture. We interrogate how medievalisms are produced discursively and how the fluid referent of the �medieval� is deployed across cultures and mediums for aesthetic and ideological purposes. From pop culture to high theory, the medieval as �other� produces periodizations that lay the foundations of cultural and institutional identities.Using the Middle Ages as a nexus, we aim to foster a dialogue between classicists, medievalists, and modernists. From a fundamentally interdisciplinary standpoint, we are committed to rethinking the divisions within and between departments based on these periodizations. Our biweekly reading group focuses on medievalism in many contexts: film, literature, and theory; reenactments, performances, and festivals; religion, politics, and law; poetry, music, and visual arts; tourism, Eurocentrism, and globalization. The "medieval" forms the object, not the subject, of our study.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>The mission of Omega Phi Beta Sorority, Incorporated is to serve and educate people of diverse backgrounds through sisterhood, leadership and guidance.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Established with ASUC 11/9/11 SB 137 Fall 2011&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 3 years of hard work, dedication, and perseverance, Omega Phi Beta Sorority, Incorporated received recognition by the Pan-Hellenic Council at the University of California, Berkeley. In May of 2011, five strong and dedicated women took Berkeley by storm as members of Omega Phi Beta Sorority, Incorporated first UC Berkeley line, Alpha line. These women came together to create an opportunity for other women at UC Berkeley to also find a sisterhood that they could identify with. Although many women were unable to join the sisterhood as undergraduates, and become part of the Alpha line, their hard work and dedication is and will forever be recognized.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;This past year, we gave away over 5,000 pounds of furniture for free from Eshleman Hall, and every semester we give away free readers and sell clothings which we collect during Move-Out in May. We also f&lt;span style="font-size: 10px;"&gt;osters the spirit of reusing materials instead of throwing them away by providing ReUSE stations across campus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;We are a small student organization looking to expand by establishing a board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Summary>The San Quentin Education Project aims to help improve educational opportunities available to prisoners housed at San Quentin State Prison.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;The San Quentin Education Project aims to help improve educational opportunities available to prisoners housed at San Quentin State Prison. The program will serve as a "clearing house" of sorts, coordinating efforts of the Berkeley Law community to partner with organizations currently providing education services at San Quentin. In the short-term, the program will focus on plugging Boalt students into existing programs; beginning in the Fall 2012 semester, however, Boalt students will play a greater role in designing and implementing curricula based on their particular interests and skills. Overall, the aim will be to foster a culture of volunteerism connecting Boalt and San Quentin, and to increase Boalt students' involvement with the CA corrections and rehabilitation system.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>To create an interdisciplinary space for mixed race studies dialogue and to provide a safe space for scholars to discuss issues of mixed race identity.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;In traditional Ethnic Studies categories, mixed race has been marginalized, misappropriated, tokenized or simply left out. In order to allow for a collaborative environment given the use of essentialized racial categories and the lack of scholarship on the experiences of mixed race people, the purposes of TMABS are follows: to create an interdisciplinary space for mixed race studies dialogue and to provide a safe space for scholars to discuss issues of mixed race identity. This group will also serve as a space for scholars doing work on this topic to present work current projects and to discuss collaboration on future research projects. We also plan to compose panels for conferences such as the Critical Mixed Race Studies Conference and the Association for Asian American Studies Conference as an organization. Some of the group members' research interests include mixed race identity and the US Census, mixed race youth political activism, Amerasian studies (Okinawan, Vietnamese, and other sites of US military involvement in Asia), transnational discourse, the Asian diaspora in Latin America and the effects of conquest and colonization on indigenous Asian peoples. A few of the theories the group is interested in exploring are Grounded Theory, Critical Race Theory, Racial Formation Theory, Mestizaje/Borderlands theory (Anzaldua) and theories of hybridity and the third space (Bhabaha). Overall, as a result of the discussions in the organization, we hope to encourage and promote research on this topic, to solidify a legitimate space in academia for the study of mixed race/bi-cultural/transnational peoples and to bring together scholars from multiple disciplines and research areas to collaborate on future research in this area.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Ventures@Berkeley helps to solve two problems. Hardly do students have the opportunity to get involved in Venture Capital due to its high entry requirement. We are here to help students get started through learning-by-doing and gain exposure to the VC world as well as to gain connections within the VC community. We will also help Berkeley startups to get connected with prominent VCs and assist them in the funding process. Ventures@Berkeley leverages the existing network of its founders and helps to bridge the missing gap among students, VCs, and Berkeley start-ups.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;*General meetings on Wednesday at 7 pm in 215 Dwinelle. Join us!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; We at the World Literacy Project believe that literacy is the key to a better world. This year, we will be hosting two reading programs for elementary students in partnership with the Berkeley Public Library and John Muir Elementary School, working with local and international NGOs to raise literacy awareness and designing another l&lt;span class="text_exposed_show"&gt;iteracy program that Cal students will implement abroad over Summer 2014. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Begun in 2010, WLP has demonstrated its commitment to service by initiating literacy programs, supporting 9 Cal students to build a school in Nicaragua, hosting a Global Child Issues Forum in partnership with several SF-based nonprofits, designing a computer literacy curriculum in Guatemala and more! We regularly educate ourselves on cost-effective poverty solutions during general meetings, and continually seek partnerships with NGOs and other student groups to promote activism on the three topics we care about the most: poverty alleviation, literacy, and gender equity.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; *E-mail us at worldliteracyproject@gmail.com&lt;br /&gt; *Facebook group at &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/126992470712170/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.facebook.com/groups/126992470712170/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>The Youth Empowerment Program (YEP) provides a network of support and hope to immigrant children held in federal custody by connecting them to student role models from the University of California. </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Far from loved ones, family members and any support networks they may have, unaccompanied immigrant children face many challenges. YEP uses a five-month curriculum to help detained youth develop teamwork and leadership skills, reflect upon their past and make positive plans for their future while connecting with college student mentors. YEP provides an extensive leadership training program for volunteers by bringing in experts in the social work, psychology and legal fields with the purpose of building future leaders for social justice. YEP volunteers utilize their leadership immediately by working with detained unaccompanied immigrant children every other week and engaging in direct community outreach.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>GA Bay Area Scientists in Schools</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;h2 class="x_x_x_x_rteleft"&gt;Program Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bay Area Scientists in Schools (BASIS) is a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;science role model volunteer program&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;for public elementary schools in the East Bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goals of BASIS are to connect a diverse range of scientist volunteers to elementary and middle school students and teachers, to inspire students with examples of real-world science careers and issues, to engage students in hands-on, inquiry based learning experiences, and to create effective teaching links between scientists and public elementary schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Program Mechanics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community Resources for Science (CRS) works with BASIS volunteers to help develop hands-on activities that are age-appropriate and based in the California Science Standards. Scientists then select dates and times that they are available to visit classrooms to make lesson presentations, and teachers are invited to sign up for presentations as they become available. "Tremendous! More, please!" is the top comment CRS hears from teachers who've had a BASIS visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists may work solo or in teams to develop a presentation to take to multiple classrooms over the course of a school year.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>Beyond Academia is a graduate student and postdoc-run career education conference that aims to expose PhDs to career options outside of academia.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;The second annual Beyond Academia conference will take place on&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;February 20 and 21, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;at the International House on the UC Berkeley campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Keynote speakers this year are Peter Fiske and Ellen Levy&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Focus areas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;DAY 1: use your science&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Focus on careers that require specific technical skills or knowledge that is directly related to your current research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;DAY 2: use your translatable skills&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Focus on careers that value the critical thinking, management, and communication skills acquired during your training, independent of your area of research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Who should attend?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The conference is targeted at both PhD students and postdocs. If you are considering a career outside of academia or are simply interested in hearing about many career options available to PhDs, we encourage you to attend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Get On The Bus is a program of The Center for Restorative Justice Works, a non profit organization that unites children, families and communities separated by crime and the criminal justice system throughout California. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Get on the Bus - Berkeley is a part of this project, aiming to raise awareness of the situation of these children as well as raising money in order to help these children to get in contact, and to stay in contact with their parents.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Summary>The mission of PATHS Mentoring Program is to connect UCB undergraduates to high school youth to share experiences and develop supportive relationships in a one-on-one environment.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000000;"&gt;PATHS is a mentoring program that connects UC Berkeley undergraduates to students at Oakland High School. Our goal is to use one-on-one mentoring and group work to encourage these high school students to pursue a higher education. Through building a relationship with a college student, we hope to provide guidance and create a space of trust and respect to encourage personal growth. Every week we present workshops, coordinate bonding activities, and act as role models to our students. We also organize an annual UC Berkeley Campus Tour to show them around the school, let them look inside classrooms/ongoing lectures, show them the students dorms, and have a professor come speak to them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>Hosts a speaker series to prepare students to transition from students to the career path</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;The speaker series is called Stories from the Career Path.. The purpose of the speaker series is to give students valuable lessons to help them make career choices. Many students today need guidance in making decisions while transitioning between school and finding work they love. There seems to be a gap between the acquisition of knowledge in school and its application to students&amp;rsquo; passions at a professional level. This educational lecture series is an attempt to bridge the knowledge gap that exists and give advice to students how to find that career that is right for them.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>established 10.17.12, SB 85 F12</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;established 10.17.12, SB 85 F12.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The mission of the Student Environmental Resource Center is to strengthen the collective effectiveness and durability of campus sustainability efforts by providing information, opportunities, and services to students and student groups with an interest in sustainability and environmental justice.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;SERC was formed out of a need of creating a central location for several groups interested in sustainability and environmental justice issues. At UC Berkeley, more than 30 student organizations focus on environmental justice issues and sustainability on campus, however they lack collaboration among each other. Within just a single academic year, SERC has become institutionalized at the university and is now serving as the official umbrella group for 30+, diverse sustainable/environmental student groups. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Ultimately, SERC&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;works with all sorts of organizations that are making an effort to improve sustainability on campus and counteract environmental injustice; from fraternities and sororities to our locally owned student food collective. Most importantly, we are in the process of building coalitions with other groups off campus that in the past have not felt the connection with students such as low income communities in the Richmond area (nearby refinery where explosion occurred a year ago).&lt;/p&gt;

      <Name>The Conscious Network</Name>
      <Status>Active</Status>
      <ShortName>TCN</ShortName>
      <Summary>The Conscious Network unites local communities on a global scale to co-create a new, sustainable future through a culture of meaning and connection. 
</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is The Conscious Network?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conscious Network is an ever-evolving movement that unites local communities on a global scale to co-create a new, sustainable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conscious Network creates new kinds of real-world spaces, which serve as interactive, non-ideological platforms for connection, self-reflection and meaningful action. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conscious Network can be thought of as collection of diverse, interconnected spaces that, at their core, are all dedicated to building a new, authentic way of life&amp;mdash;one grounded in self-awareness, individual fulfillment, and human connection.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does The Conscious Network do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conscious Network creates open, interactive spaces in local communities that allow community members to gather, connect with one another, and engage in meaningful action together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each space The Conscious Network creates has a unique purpose. For instance, a Community Space is designed to foster community connections, while an Action Space is designed to promote social action. However, at their core, each and every space is unified in its aim: to create a culture that promotes individual fulfillment and collective prosperity, while fostering human connection and self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else do The Conscious Network do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conscious Network also connects each space it creates to a local network of other spaces. For instance, Berkeley&amp;rsquo;s Community Space is connected to its Action Space and its Gift Space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connected spaces in any given region form a local network. For instance, each space in Berkeley is part of The Berkeley Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each local network functions independently and autonomously. However, all local networks are connected to one another. For instance, The Berkeley Network may chose to work with The San Francisco Network on a project that concerns both regions. Likewise, The Berkeley and San Francisco Networks may chose to connect and work with the L.A Network on an issue that affects all of California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conscious Network is, then, a network of networks. Each local network is linked to a series of other networks, creating a global network: The Conscious Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Why the world needs The Conscious Network:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conscious Network is guided by an enduring belief that real and lasting change is possible if we can connect on an authentic level, discover our shared values, and act together. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, our world is in need of public spaces that allow us to connect and and work together to create the new, sustainable future we all desire. The Conscious Network meets this need. It provides new, non-ideological spaces in which we can grow as individuals and communities, and together change the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conscious Network provides a model for the future. The spaces it creates foster a shared, sustainable culture of meaning and connection. Out of this culture, a new global narrative is emerging&amp;mdash;one grounded in a healthy optimism, and a full appreciation of our individual and collective potential.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;The UC Haiti Initiative (UCHI) is a group of faculty, students, alumni, and several members of the administration dedicated mobilizing resources of the UC system for assistance in Haiti reconstruction. We aim to form partnerships with Haitian academic counterparts, civil society organizations, NGOs, and Haitian Government agencies in a defined municipality to enhance capacity building through education and research. We will focus on six core areas: (1) Agriculture, (2) Arts History &amp;amp; Culture, (3) Economics &amp;amp; Law, (4) Education &amp;amp; Psychosocial Assistance, (5) Engineering Architecture &amp;amp; Technology, and (6) Health Care. All projects will emphasize initiative and direction by our Haitian partnering institutions and organizations to establish self-sustaining, long term mechanisms for continued development. We hope to build a community of students, faculty, and administration at UC Berkeley dedicated to long-term sustained development in Haiti.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of our group is to promote dialogue about different kinds of diversity among those who do work in Mathematics. We are a group of Math graduate students and have a particular interest in the Math graduate student experience at Berkeley.

      <Status>Active</Status>
      <ShortName>BF</ShortName>
      <Summary>The Berkeley Forum is a non-partisan forum for the expression and debate of a wide range of ideas. Founded in 2012, the Forum organizes panels, debates, and talks by leading experts and distinguished persons on issues both topical and timeless.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;The Berkeley Forum is a non-partisan forum for the expression and debate of a wide range of ideas. Founded in 2012, the Forum organizes panels, debates, and talks by leading experts and distinguished persons on issues both topical and timeless. Forum events are open to the public and will be broadcast online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Forum is run entirely by undergraduate students at the University of California, Berkeley, though it is advised by a committee of distinguished professors. Berkeley Forum members are motivated, intellectually curious students from a diverse range of academic and professional backgrounds. The Forum provides students valuable first-hand experience and a channel to explore and challenge the ideas that motivate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Organization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guiding authority of the Forum rests in the president and an executive committee, composed of the president and two vice presidents. The president and executive committee of the Forum are responsible for the day-to-day operations, the long-term growth, and ultimate success of the Forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forum operations are carried out by two standing committees, each of which is chaired by a vice president. Each standing committee plays a central role in the planning and realization of Forum events. A programming affairs committee recruits guest speakers, handles travel and accommodation arrangements, and creates the program for Forum events. A communications committee publicizes all Forum events and serves as curator of the organization&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s brand and graphic standards. The president may from time-to-time, with the advice and consent of the executive committee, form special committees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Forum also houses a systems and technology division, in charge of web design and other technology-related tasks, a development division, in charge of fundraising, and an external affairs division, which oversees membership recruiting and outreach efforts. Each division is overseen by a director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Mission&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission of the Berkeley Forum is to provide the Berkeley community a non-partisan forum for the presentation and debate of a wide range of ideas; to reaffirm the value of a liberal arts education; and to regularly organize, promote, and broadcast debates, panels, and talks by distinguished persons, and any such events, activities, or conversations as shall engage and challenge the faculties of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Admission to Forum events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admission to Forum Events is free for all members of the Forum and persons affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley. This includes students, professors, administrators, and other staff members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fee of $5 (as of March 2013) will be required of all other event attendees and will be collected at the event, unless otherwise noted.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Berkeley Innovation is a human-centered design group at UC Berkeley. Our members come from a wide range of disciplines, but share a love of design thinking and innovation. Each semester, we work on design projects that give members hands-on experience with the entire design process, from conducting user research to building and marketing prototypes. We exist as a community for students who are interested in design to develop their design thinking skills and experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARTICLE I &amp;ndash; Name&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 1. The name of the organization shall be &amp;ldquo;Capital Investments at Berkeley&amp;rdquo;, hereafter referred to as CIB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 2. The Executive Board of CIB, hereafter referred as the &amp;lsquo;Executive Board,&amp;rsquo; shall be made up of one President, the Vice President of Portfolio Management, the Vice President of Operations and the Vice President of Investment Research. Officer positions shall be created as deemed necessary by the Executive Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 3. The Alumni Advisor is a founder of CIB and serves as a consultant, and is only involved in the major decision-making and approval processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARTICLE II &amp;ndash;Purpose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital Investments at Berkeley is a student-run initiative that aims to educate UC Berkeley students on necessary skills for trading alternative investment products. Through our capital investments fund (CIB fund), students will gain first-hand experience in exploring and executing various trading strategies. Meanwhile, we also seek to deliver long term and consistent absolute returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CIB fund is a student investment fund which pools money from investors at UC Berkeley and other universities. Officers and the Executive Board members are responsible for managing the portfolio and following the requirements strictly set by the investment mandate, liability waivers and prospectus of the CIB fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARTICLE III &amp;ndash; Membership&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 1. Only currently registered students, faculty and staff may be active members in CIB. Members are allowed to participate in general meetings and events organized by the officers of CIB. CIB will take members&amp;rsquo; advice into consideration. However, members do have not voting power in the decision making process of managing the CIB fund. Only active members may vote or hold office. &lt;strong&gt;SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 2. CIB considers hazing to be a degrading and destructive activity, which is inconsistent with the standards of this student organization. We will strictly abide by relevant California State laws. CIB recognizes the dignity of every person and opposes all forms of hazing. We will not haze according to California State Law.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 3. We will not restrict membership based upon race, color, national origin, religion, sex, physical and mental disability, medical condition (cancer-related or genetic characteristics), ancestry, marital status, age, sexual orientation, citizenship or status as a covered veteran (special disabled veteran, Vietnam-era veteran or any other veteran who served on active duty during a war or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized).&lt;strong&gt; SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARTICLE IV - Analysts/Officers/Appointment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 1. Analyst&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of each semester, the Executive Board shall recruit analysts. The Executive Board will design a training program to equip analysts will the necessary skills to serve the purpose of CIB, which is to educate members on trading various financial products and to manage the CIB fund in a professional manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Executive Board shall conduct at least a 20 minute interview with each potential candidate for the analyst program. The Executive Board will identify the most suitable candidate to become analysts. The appointment must be confirmed by the President and the Alumni Advisor will be notified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 2. Officers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIB shall have the following Executive Board members, which shall be nominated by the members of the current Executive Board and appointed by the President of Capital Investments at Berkeley:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The President shall preside over all meetings of CIB, shall be an ex-officio member of all committees established by the Board, and shall have the power to appoint members to such committees, as the Board shall establish. The President shall be responsible for the overall activities of CIB and shall represent CIB in all official matters, unless he or she chooses to delegate the above duties. Furthermore, in all meetings of the Board and of all other Committees created by the Board, the President, has the right to make final decisions regarding all matters of CIB with support from the Alumni Advisor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Alumni Advisor is the founder of CIB, and is an alumnus of UC Berkeley. He is not involved in the daily operations of CIB. He is also not involved in most of the decision making process of the CIB fund. He is only responsible for the final approvals after the Executive Board members and gives advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vice Presidents shall assume such duties delegated to them by the President. In the event of the President's absence, disability, or resignation, the Vice Presidents shall assume the duties of the President in the manner provided under Article IV section 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vice President of Operations shall have charge of internal functions, manage external contacts, establish and maintain good public relationships, mediate members&amp;rsquo; concerns, and oversight of financial affairs of CIB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Authored by Senator Daley Vertiz and Monica Ruiz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sponsored by Senator Daley Vertiz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;WHEREAS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Capital Investments at Berkeley (CIB) was founded in 2011 to allow UC Berkeley students to learn about the markets through real experience; and, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;WHEREAS, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;there are a lack of campus organizations that teach students about the financial world in an in-depth manner; and, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;WHEREAS,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;CIB aims to provide consistent returns with minimal risk exposure through utilizing equities, derivatives and alternative investment products; and, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;WHEREAS, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;By managing an actual money fund comprised of investments from club members and external investors, club members make real decisions to achieve real growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;; and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;WHEREAS, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;CIB&amp;rsquo;s mission is to increase financial awareness and knowledge in the student body&amp;nbsp;through its analyst training program, a semester-long crash course in trading that exposes analysts to most of the financial instruments including securities, options, and bonds; and, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;WHEREAS,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; CIB hosts weekly conference calls to discuss market trends and predictions; and, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;WHEREAS, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;CIB also develops members professionally by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;hosting corporate sponsors to assist with recruitment and to educate students about careers/career planning in the finance industry; and, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; the ASUC recognizes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Capital Investments at Berkeley (CIB) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;as a 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;st&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; year ASUC Sponsored Student Activity Group (SAG). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;The need for employees with knowledge in the science of computer programming is more important then ever before. Our mission is to educate high school students on how to access, download and learn coding programs, such as Python. Through workshops, which will take place at various high schools in the adjacent area surrounding Berkeley, and 24/7 communication and instruction with program participants, we plan to provide the necessary tools for eager students to gain an advantage in the field of computer science.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>The Concrete Canoe team at UC Berkeley competes every year in the ASCE sponsored concrete canoe competition.  Our team challenges students to apply their knowledge obtained in their courses to a hands-on project.  </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;We provide a welcoming community where students can learn, gain hands-on experience, and create something they can be proud of. &amp;nbsp;The concrete canoe team is unique from the other student organizations because we encompass many disciplines of civil engineering, and provide a unique opportunity for students to grow. &amp;nbsp;Participating in our team exposes students to many of the branches of civil engineering, such as construction, materials design, structural, and environmental. &amp;nbsp;In addition, as a competition team, we help individuals build leadership and teamwork skills. &amp;nbsp;Our team also has a long history of competition and success, which allows students to call upon a large knowledgeable alumni network. &amp;nbsp;Concrete Canoe here at UC Berkeley provides a great opportunity for students to grow outside of their courses.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;In partnership with the Raise Hope for Congo Campaign of the Enough Project, the Conflict Free Campus Initiative at Berkeley aims to harness the power of student leadership and activism to bring about peace in Congo. By encouraging university officials and stakeholders, both of whom are large purchasers of electronics and powerful spokespersons, to commit to measures that pressure electronics companies to responsibly invest in Congo's minerals sector, we can voice our demand for conflict-free products from Congo. Comprehensive reform is needed in Congo to bring about sustainable peace- now is the time is now for students to lead the conflict-free movement for peace in eastern Congo.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>The IAP provides educational and financial access to high-achieving students who face socio-economic barriers from underserved communities. We commit to cultivate future leaders through civic engagement and provide services to succeed at Cal and beyond.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;h3&gt;SERVICE OBJECTIVES&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;v Empower and develop leaders who will affect social transformation in their various communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;v Cultivate long-lasting relationships within the IAP community of Scholars, Alumni, Staff, Donors, and High School Partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Committed to developing future leaders, IAP has established the service requirement to support the program&amp;rsquo;s mission and objectives, as well as, to provide their scholars with opportunities for personal growth, professional development, and service to their communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an IAP scholarship recipient, you are required to perform certain types of service in order to keep your scholarship. The IAP staff has developed this packet to further explain the details in satisfying the service requirement, and to provide you with a list of options for completing your service activities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fulfill the service requirement, you will be asked &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;complete a total of four different services activities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; from four different service categories each academic year. The scholar &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;will need to complete two service activities forms per semester&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and use the &lt;em&gt;Service Requirement Form &lt;/em&gt;to verify their completion. The service categories consist of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Service to Self&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Service to IAP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Service to Community&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Service to IAP Partner High School&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars can decide on the order in which the categories are completed each semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAMPLE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Fall Semester&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Spring Semester&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <Summary>Portraits of Kindness at Berkeley is a club through which students create portraits of orphans from around the world to honor their heritage, help build a positive self-esteem, and commemorate their childhood. Contact info is under "read more"!</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mission:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mission is to encourage UC Berkeley students to turn their artistic skills into something greater than simply art. Through our projects, we nurture the lives of orphans worldwide and inspire the Berkeley community to share kindness with those in need&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Process:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants receive photos of orphans waiting for portraits and then work from those photos to create portraits (drawings, paintings, digital art). Next, the portraits are delivered to the orphans as gifts. Finally, each artist receives a photo of the rpahn holding his/her portrait!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intrested for more information or would like to join:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shoot us a message on facebook.com/PortraitsofKindness or email us at PortraitsOfKindness@gmail.com!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <Summary>Promote unity among Zoroastrian students and other members of the campus community by examining the history, identity, and beliefs of the Zoroastrian religion through cultural, religious, and academic events.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;This organization will act to unite Zoroastrians of the greater Bay area through community outreach and activates. Members of the organization will work together to further understand the origins and teachings of the Zoroastrian religion, as well as help to bring this knowledge to fellow Zoroastrians in the area. Members will also strive to establish a stronger connection between Zoroastrians in the greater Bay Area, as well as work to establish more of a community among them. We will plan and hold events for Zoroastrians, which will hopefully form a more tight-knit Zoroastrian community. These events will also provide a way for more Zoroastrians to meet each other and hopefully also provide a large networking opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <ShortName>CASA</ShortName>
      <Summary>The Cal Alumni Student Association (CASA) is UC Berkeley's premier student organization for engagement between students and alumni.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mission &amp;amp; Vision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Cal Alumni Student Association (CASA)&lt;/strong&gt; aims to be the flagship student group for engaging students and alumni and building student and alumni leaders. Furthermore, CASA strives to inspire Cal students to become engaged alumni through volunteerism, community building, and philanthropy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formation of CASA was the result of the Leadership Award Scholars Association (LASA) and the Student Alumni Relations Council (SARC) joining forces to create a new student group supported by the Cal Alumni Association (CAA) and aimed at engaging students and alumni and building student and alumni leaders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legacy Night:&lt;/strong&gt; Legacy Night joins Cal's top student leaders with Cal alumni to celebrate the dedication and accomplishments of students and alumni alike.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I Run 4 Cal:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;I Run 4 Cal: 5K Run/Walk is a charity race at UC Berkeley for campus departments, scholarships, programs, and student groups.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top Dogs with Top Dogs:&lt;/strong&gt; Top Dogs with Top Dogs is an opportunity for students to engage with Cal alumni who share their extracurricular and career path goals -- accompanied by a Top Dog lunch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overnight Stay Program:&lt;/strong&gt; CASA's flagship program, the Overnight Stay Program (OSP) provides approximately 800 high school seniors who have been accepted to UC Berkeley with the opportunity to experience life as a Cal student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tier 2 Programming (TTP):&lt;/strong&gt; CASA offers additional programming, such as workshops and socials, aimed at engaging students and alumni and providing professional resources.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Summary>OpenDialogues promotes personal growth by cultivating life stories through dialogue-centric mentorship.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;We define OpenDialogues as mutually beneficial, uninhibited, non-prescriptive conversations built around various life themes. Through open dialogues, we can better develop our life story which propels us to attain greater personal growth and future achievements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our program is based on the notion that everyone is greatly impacted by our informal conversations -- we are enriched by actively engaging with each other. In OpenDialogues, each participant has a unique role to play, and each mentorship pair has unique stories to share. Our program is focused on facilitating this dynamic, through which we aim to shape life stories one open dialogue at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students and mentors are connected one-on-one to make a mentorship pair, with all pairs forming A Modern Mentorship Community.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>The Space Exploration Society at Berkeley is the Berkeley chapter for Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (SEDS) and The Planetary Society (TPS). Our goal is to stimulate interest in a space-related career for students of all majors.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;By inspiring the next generation of space scientists, we hope to accelerate the development and exploration of space. We will accomplish our goals by forming a network of students interested in space, providing leadership opportunities, educating both students and non-students with scientific outreach, participating in space-related competitions (rocket-building, 3D printing, space policy), and interacting with professional organizations and companies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Space Exploration Society at Berkeley is the only club at Berkeley to promote the exploration and development of space. We serve as the de facto astronomy club at Berkeley since it is directly related to space interests. &amp;nbsp;We are also the first interdisciplinary society for encouraging space interests and soliciting members from all majors including engineering, the physical sciences, humanities, and all others.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>The purpose of The Thought Lounge is to provide a space for the students of Berkeley to capitalize on the opportunity to have their peers be their teachers. </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;It seems that each student in Cal is often passionate and super-interested in certain topics that classroom discussions fail to address. Each Thought Lounge meeting will act as a mini-forum wherein members will be expected to present and engage in dialogues concerned with varying topics of personal interest. Connections and relations formed between these different ideas presented will be highlighted at the end of each meeting.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>The purpose of the Triathlon Club at Berkeley is to bring the sport of triathlon to the student community at the University of California, Berkeley and its surrounding environs.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Triathlon is a multi-sport event consisting of swimming, biking, and running that offers a potential for lifelong enjoyment and passion. It is this lifestyle that the Triathlon Club at Berkeley seeks to bring to its members. Finally, this club hopes to represent a standard in the organization, competition, and applicability for collegiate triathlon clubs around the nation. We will bring the sport of triathlon to the aforementioned groups and entities through a combination of detailed education about all stages of the sport, offering organized practices, as well as a sharing of our resources. These resources include access to our monetary resources for organized team events, access to our sponsorships to make the sport more affordable, and access to the array of experience and knowledge about the sport accumulated by the members.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <ShortName />
      <Summary>Our purpose is to provide tennis coaching and equipment to youth aged 5-17 in the Berkeley area.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Our proposed organization is different from existing tennis clubs at UC Berkeley because it targets underprivileged youth (ages 5-17) and not college students in the Berkeley area. Youth that demonstrate financial need can sign up for access to weekly lessons and equipment. Our club will provide a unique volunteer experience for Berkeley students interested in sharing their tennis talent with youth who normally wouldn't have access to coaching. Berkeley students that don't play tennis but are still interested in our cause are also welcome to aid in facilitation of practices and purchasing drinks and snacks for the kids.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>Global Student Embassy at Berkeley looks to bring Cal students together with international communities in order to create positive, grassroots change on a local and multinational scale. </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;GSE promotes peace and equitable development by connecting young people from around the world through innovative workshops and service learning exchanges. We believe that students are young ambassadors who can practice grassroots international relations by identifying local issues, collaborating with their global peers, and implementing projects that create positive change within the community. We currently have projects in Northern California, Nicaragua, and Ecuador building school gardens with a focus in biointensive agriculture. Our goal is to send Cal students to GSE's sister gardens in order to learn, through experience, about social and environmental justice as well as sustainable farming techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global Student Embassy is unique in that it seeks to create a dialogue across international borders on a wide range of issues including grassroots organizing, social justice, public health, environmental crises, and more. We are a diverse group of students and organizers interested in banding together in order to address problems that affect as all.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Name>International Human Rights Workshop</Name>
      <Status>Active</Status>
      <ShortName />
      <Summary>Started in 2012, the International Human Rights Workshop (IHRW) was developed as part of the SLPS program.  The workshop was created to give 1L and LLM students hands-on experience in international human rights work.  </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;IHRW currently partners with the Human Rights Center (HRC), under the supervision of the Director of the Sexual Violence Program, Kim Thuy Seelinger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013-14, IHRW will assist the three main projects at the HRC, the Forensic Program, Global Justice Program, and Sexual Violence Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students will have the opportunity to hone their legal research and writing skills and develop knowledge of domestic and international laws. The Forensic Program will give students the opportunity to assist the Contra Costa District Attorney&amp;rsquo;s Office in gaining a more comprehensive understanding of victim behavior after an attack. Students assisting the Global Justice Program will work on war crimes research by conducting background research on victim participation in the International Criminal Court. Students assisting the Sexual Violence Program will respond directly to the needs of public defenders and judges in Liberia by researching the right to confront an accuser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IHRW is unique because it serves the international, and local, human rights community. The community is served by UC Berkeley students who are able to interact with real projects within the human rights sphere. This year, because the forensics project is local, it also serves students who are interested in criminal justice and those who want to work directly with a district attorney. Additionally, students who are not directly part of the workshop can participate in large group trainings and learn about the research activities of the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IHRW has an impact on local and global communities. This year the Sexual Violence Project will be working directly with DA&amp;rsquo;s and judges in Liberia to answer questions about the right to face your accused. The research in this area will focus on ways accusers can safely participate in court proceedings in Liberia. The Global Justice Project is working to look at victim rights of participation in proceedings at the ICC. Finally, the Forensics Project will serve the Contra Costa District Attorney&amp;rsquo;s Office to assist with early injury detection in domestic violence cases.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Name>Irish Dancers of Berkeley</Name>
      <Status>Active</Status>
      <ShortName />
      <Summary>We aim to provide a time, place, and platform for Irish dancers of all experience levels to practice, perform, and explore all aspects of Irish dance, while bringing a bit of craic to Cal!</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;For many college-aged Irish dancers, it is difficult to continue participating in this cultural art form and sport for several reasons. When they move away from their dance company, they do not have space to practice, they do not have the same incentive of teamwork and camaraderie that is so central to the activity, and they do not have the chance to perform.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Irish Dancers of Berkeley does regular stamina and technique workouts, but we also choreograph traditional and contemporary performance routines. The group is actively seeking opportunities to perform in and around Berkeley, and could potentially compete in intercollegiat competitions. There are several collegiate Irish dance teams around the country. Seeing as UC Berkeley is one of the top universities in the world, we ought to have a group to represent the Bears when Irish dance groups meet up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This art form is thriving in the Bay Area, and Cal should be connected to this Irish community. The Irish Dancers of Berkeley can and will serve as cultural ambassadors around campus, the Bay, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>The Phoenix Scholars are dedicated to empowering underserved youth to pursue their dream of a college degree by guiding them through the college application process. </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;8% of kids growing up in low-income communities graduate from college by the age of 24. The Phoenix Scholars is looking to change that.&amp;nbsp;This organization is a chapter of the non-profit organization The Phoenix Scholars, which is created and currently based at Stanford University. Furthermore, this organization is unique because we have a goal in our mentorship: to guide our mentees through the college application process and help them pursue their dreams of a 4-year degree. We work together with the team at Stanford to coordinate mentor-mentee relations. This is more than just a mentorship program; mentors and mentees find common ground even if they are from different backgrounds, and this program is more college-focused.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>A UC Berkeley student organization for students of the Environmental Economics and Policy major and minor to network, socialize and prepare for post graduation.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;div class="x_x_mhl"&gt;BEEPS (Berkeley Environmental Economics and Policy Students) seeks to bring students of the EEP major together through conceptualizing, collaborating, networking, learning and socializing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="x_x_mhl"&gt;
&lt;div class="x_x_mvm x_x_uiP x_x_fsm"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="x_x_id_521569a0433154f55299272" class="x_x_text_exposed_root"&gt;As a group of friends in the EEP major, we thought it would be fun to have a place where other EEP students could come and meet each other. This idea grew to not only include community building and socializing, but to provide resources for EEP majors to be better prepared for the professional world.&amp;nbsp;These resources will include talks from professionals, alumni, professors, and graduate students, as well as software workshops and peer tutoring.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The plan is to hold general meetings every other week, where the officers bring in speakers (e.g. EEP alumni) to discuss their career paths and to answer our questions. Occasionally, we will hold review sessions, software workshops, and fun social events. We want to prepare ourselves for the future and have fun doing it!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="x_x_mhl"&gt;
&lt;div class="x_x_mvm x_x_uiP x_x_fsm"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
Contact officers at calbeeps@gmail.com to get on the list serve or ask general questions.&lt;/div&gt;</Description>

      <Status>Active</Status>
      <ShortName />
      <Summary>The Cal Seismic Design Competition Team provides for UC Berkeley students to learn about earthquake engineering. The group must create a five foot balsa wood structure that has to   undergo three different earthquakes of varying strength &amp; length.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Starting with the design process all the way to the construction phase, members will be utilizing their engineering skills along with other outside resources to perform successfully. Throughout the year, the group will meet to brainstorm ideas for the design, proposals for the overall look, and actual construction of the structure. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the college does not have specified classes for this emphasis, this group focuses on applying their knowledge and intuition into a competition based team. Competing in the Undergraduate Seismic Design Competition, held by the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI), is the main focus of this group.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>Empowering children with disabilities through financial and non-financial means.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;SDC Blue Ribbon Foundation is originally based out of Canada. It was run for three years. During two of those three years, the organization designed, funded, and ran an after school program to help children with disabilities through music therapy. Over 100 children participated in this program. It is currently still running and in its fifth term. Our organization plans on reproducing the same program in the United States along with other initiatives to support children with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Name>Phi Delta Theta</Name>
      <Status>Active</Status>
      <ShortName />
      <Summary>The oldest continuous chapter at Berkeley.  A brotherhood with a rich tradition that emphasizes academics, honor, and fraternal bonds.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Phi Delta Theta was organized with three principle objectives: The cultivation of friendship among its members, the acquirement individually of a high degree of mental culture, and the attainment personally of a high standard of morality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These objectives, referred to as the Cardinal Principles, have guided over 225,000 men since 1848 when the Fraternity was founded at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fraternity teaches men that these areas of commitment, outlined in The Bond of Phi Delta Theta, are not to be viewed as separate ideals, but as areas of discipline for daily life. Developments intellectually, in leadership, and human service (to name a few) are vital to the men of Phi Delta Theta. A member will support, and in turn have the support of, his brothers as these principles are lived out.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>Sigma Epsilon Omega (SEO), UC Berkeley’s only queer and allies fraternity provides male students with a unique opportunity to be included in a safe space focused around respect, community, and respect.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Sigma Epsilon Omega (SEO), UC Berkeley&amp;rsquo;s only queer and allies fraternity and one of the few recognized queer and allies fraternities in the nation, provides male students a unique opportunity to be included in a safe space focused around respect , community, and acceptance. Founded by 3 students at UC Berkeley, SEO has continued to break barriers and stereotypes of both the queer and Greek communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though SEO is one of the newer fraternities on campus, we already have incredible accomplishments under our belt. We have seen rapid growth of ourfFraternity starting with a class of 23 Brothers. We also already have a house&amp;nbsp;to call our own! Being a housed chapter is a significant accomplishment for a new fraternity, and provides all of our Brothers with a unique and amazing housing opportunity. Feel free to check out our&amp;nbsp;house at 2708 Channing Way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As brothers, we aim to improve the school community by getting involved in various philanthropy and activism events by raising money, creating awareness, and participating in volunteer work. We seek to foster and maintain a brotherhood that is based on individual and collective strength, equality, and opportunity. We strive to provide an exciting and vibrant social space specifically, but not exclusively, for queer males.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Sigma Epsilon Omega is a predominatnly queer fraternity, our brotherhood is open to any individual that identifies as male and supports our mission statement. Every individual that rushes (straight, bi-sexual, gay, queer, etc.) will be treated equally and will be put through the same process.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;SigEp is not your stereotypical social fraternity. We believe in the Balanced Man Program, which leaves no room for hazing, pledging, or discrimination by race or sexual orientation. Instead, SigEp practices a four year development program which provides each man with opportunities to further his own personal development. For over one hundred years at Berkeley, SigEp has surpassed the limits of what it means to be Greek.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

Theta Delt's IM Dodgeball team is currently a 4-peat championship team. We also have competitive IM basketball and soccer teams.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Only through the strong friendship among its members would all of these things be possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Name>Iota Phi Theta Fraternity, Inc.</Name>

      <ShortName />
      <Summary>The fraternity was founded by twelve men in the midst of the Civil Rights Movement. Influences included organizations such as the Black Panthers, SNCC, plus individuals like Malcolm X, and Stokely Carmichael. </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Iota Phi Theta Fraternity, Inc. was founded on Morgan State College in 1963 in Baltimore Maryland. We abide by five principles of Scholarship, Leadership, Brotherhood, Fidelity &amp;amp; Citizenship. Our mission is Building a Tradition, Not Resting Upon One.&amp;nbsp;Iota brothers participated in various protests and sit-ins throughout the city of Baltimore. The founders were distinguished from their peers as they were all non-traditional students. Older than their peers, many had served in the military, working full-time while attending classes, and having families. On September 19, 1963, in the height of the Civil Rights' Movement, these twelve founders gathered together on the steps of Hurt Gymnasium on the campus of Morgan State College (now known as Morgan State University) and formed Iota Phi Theta Fraternity, Inc. The fraternity was formed as a support system for men of color during the turbulent U.S. social climate of the time&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>CIA’s mission is to practice a multi-cultural, internationally-informed brand of Social Work, both domestically &amp; abroad, in order to promote Social Justice, enhance international collaboration &amp; utilize international insight to improve social welfare</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;In an age of increasing interdependence, and the advent of globalization, international social work is more relevant than ever. The C.I.A. has been formed in order to reflect this reality by: mobilizing internationally-minded undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate students, consolidating resources, merging standing curricula, and designing or re-creating international symposiums and field learning opportunities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CIA is unique amongst Berkeley student organizations as it is the only organization that bridges international and domestic social work modalities via a collaborative and multi-cultural approach. &amp;nbsp;The CIA seeks to work collaboratively with the School of Social Welfare&amp;rsquo;s administration to link currently disparate global social welfare programs under the auspice of an international field placement exchange program as set forth in the Report of the International Task Force. Furthermore, it is our goal to extend our reach beyond just the School of Social Welfare and to engage the campus at large in recreating the Berkeley International Symposium, with the goal of establishing the symposium as a recurring event.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>The sisterhood of Sigma Omicron Pi, established in 1930, is the first nastional Asian American Interest sorority. SOPi remains dedicated to its four objectives of unity, friendship, leadership, and service. </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The sisterhood of Sigma Omicron Pi was established at San Francisco State University in 1930 by ten Asian American women:&amp;nbsp;Elizabeth Hall, Frances Hall, Dorothy Lau, Gertrude Lee, Hannah Lee, Louise Lee, Fannie Lim, Nancy Lim, Emma Lum, and Beatrice Ng, pursuing the interest of teaching.

&lt;p class="x_x_font_8"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Though, the sorority, no longer centered around the interest of teaching, it still maintained its commitment to the Asian American community. All of the chapters became extremely involved in their respective communities, volunteering their time at community agencies and raising money to donate to favorable charities. Sigma Omicron Pi earned a respectable&lt;strong&gt; reputation as a benefactor&lt;/strong&gt; to the Asian American cause.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The purpose of Sigma Omicron Pi is to promote unity, lifelong friendships, leadership, and community service. This organization offers women a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;supportive network&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;of sisters to achieve &lt;strong&gt;academic and social growth&lt;/strong&gt;. The sisterhood of Sigma Omicron Pi provides an environment where sisters may utilize and develop their organizational skills.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Each one of our sisters has different interests and aspirations, yet we all share one common ground - SOPi. We have based our sisterhood on four objectives:&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;UNITY&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; FRIENDSHIP&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; LEADERSHIP and SERVICE&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition, Sigma Omicron Pi has a tradition of lifelong friendship that has prevailed for&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;over eight decades&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Summary>To teach students the skills necessary to efficiently and effective mentor high school students in a financial sense. </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to mentor young adults and teach them about the financial deficit, debt solutions, leadership, and business skills. We will institute a 7-week financial curriculum to fully prepare each student for future financial problems, regardless if they attend college. Thus, we hope to contribute to the eradication of the US financial debt by teaching and preparing our next generation of citizens.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>The PURPOSE of a NATIONAL EAGLE SCOUT ASSOCIATION AFFINITY GROUP is to help bring together Eagle Scouts, who share a common interest or affinity, for the betterment of the community, youth members of the Boy Scouts of America, and each other.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever participated in a sport or hobby and found that some of the people participating with you were Eagle Scouts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or took a class in college and realized that one of your study partners is an Eagle Scout?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps, had a conversation with someone at a seminar or trade show and recognized an Eagle Scout lapel pin on their blazer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, what happened???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After realizing the common ground of Scouting, most folks begin sharing with one another their similar camp experiences, the toughest merit badge they earned, how cool their Scoutmaster was, or maybe some of the details of their Eagle Scout project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happened after that???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, if you are like most people that is where it ends and you get back to your hobby or studying for the next exam or move on to the next networking encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Eagle Scout Association thinks it could be more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NESA believes that the common ground of Scouting and a shared vocation or hobby (including college affiliation) between Scouting alumni could lead to some really great things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick is getting organized. And that is where NESA Affinity groups come in&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>The Wildlife Society at Berkeley's mission is to educate students about wildlife-related careers and to promote wildlife conservation both locally and internationally.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;The Wildlife Society at Berkeley will be the first professional organization on campus that focuses completely on wildlife conservation. Through networking with wildlife biologists, policy makers, GIS specialists, and other wildlife professionals in the Bay Area, we will learn about local wildlife conservation issues and educate our fellow students about current events through regular work days and a monthly bulletin/flyer. We will be collaborating with the San Francisco Bay Area Chapter of the Wildlife Society to have joint volunteer and educational events, as well as having the wildlife professionals in the Society mentor students wishing to enter the field of Wildlife Conservation. Furthermore, regular camping, hiking and bird-watching trips will be organized for students to learn more about the wildlife in California.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Name>Curling Club at Berkeley</Name>
      <Status>Active</Status>
      <ShortName />
      <Summary>Our club's mission is to introduce people to the sport of curling and field a collegiate curling team to compete weekly at a recreational level. We frequently offer opportunities to learn about curling and get involved in the community. Come join us!</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Our mission: to (1) introduce people to the sport of curling and (2) compete in weekly recreational curling matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are the first collegiate curling club in the state of California, and members have the opportunity to help other colleges and universities start clubs to foster intercollegiate competition. Our long-term goal is to field teams at the US National College Curling Championship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're partnered with the &lt;a href="http://www.bayareacurling.com" target="_blank"&gt; San Francisco Bay Area Curling Club&lt;/a&gt;, and we curl at the Oakland Ice Center, which is accessible by both BART and AC Transit bus. To access by BART, take the Fremont-bound line to 19th St. Oakland station and exit via Telegraph Ave. To access by AC Transit bus, take the 1 bus toward Bay Fair BART and alight at the 19th St. Oakland BART stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in learning more about curling, get started &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling" target="_blank"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;! Also, check out &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxCH8CGqx88" target="_blank"&gt; this introduction video&lt;/a&gt; from the US Curling Association!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to follow us on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/CalCurling"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/calcurlingteam" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;!

      <Status>Active</Status>
      <ShortName />
      <Summary>The Investment Banking Student Association of Berkeley is one of the first clubs at Berkeley that focuses on all aspects of revenue-generating operations at a bulge bracket investment bank. We prepare members for summer analyst roles at investment banks.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;This organization consists of members having previously worked or planning to work at an investment bank. We have a focus on practical experience and training will consist of including financial modeling, valuation, and accounting courses taught by students and professionals having worked or who are currently working in the field. We also plan to partner with firms to hold externships at their offices, and hold investment banking case competitions on campus. Instead of being a club of purely interest in investment banking and focusing on following industry news, we differentiate ourselves by providing members significant practical case, modeling, and work experience. We only accept members who are serious about investment banking as a career path, as we will utilize our resources to help them secure a job in the field to the very best of our ability.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>Project Nur intends to implement meaningful civic, direct services, and cultural initiatives on campus centered on human rights, civil rights, social justice, understanding, and co-existence in an attempt to help diminish stereotypes and misunderstanding</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Project Nur was founded in August 2007 as a response to tensions on college campuses across the U.S. Project Nur intends to implement meaningful civic, direct services, and cultural initiatives on campus centered on human rights, civil rights, social justice, understanding, and co-existence in an attempt to help diminish stereotypes and misunderstandings. &lt;br /&gt; Project Nur will be dedicated to creating a space that allows all students to learn from, and about, each other in order to build an inter-ethnic and multi-faith student community promoting human rights and civil rights; this would ultimately result in emphasizing the positive values and expectations of all identities, while promoting co-existence, tolerance and understanding. Furthermore, Project Nur aims to emphasize positive relationships by building bridges between Muslim and non-Muslim students in order to diminish generalizations and stereotypes.&lt;br /&gt; Nur, defined in Arabic as enlightenment, will position itself as a Muslim-led forum for students from various backgrounds, cultures, and faith to come together to celebrate their differences, solidify their commonalities, and bring light or knowledge to their respective communities.&lt;br /&gt; Nationally, Project Nur is recognized as a student-led initiative of the American Islamic Congress.&lt;br /&gt; The goals of Project Nur relate to the name and mission which reach out to students to promote understanding of each other in the spirit of enlightenment.&lt;br /&gt; 1. Project Nur aims to form a social arena for students to represent a strong identity of eclectic backgrounds and opinions, while opening the doors for people of other cultures to come, share, discuss, and ask questions in a multicultural setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Project Nur's goal is to a build a student led initiative for human rights and civil rights led by students in order to denounce hate speech and violence, by being committed to co-existence, understanding and individual human and civil rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Project Nur aims to create the ground for voices of eclectic Muslim-Americans and non-Muslim Americans by working with students who are progressive, reformist, liberal, secular, moderate or conservative and without proselytizing and judging Muslims of different thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not make religious rulings, and the chapter will not provide a religious agenda. The role of Project Nur is to promote human rights, promote positive social change in the pursuit of civil rights, and celebrate cultural and social identities students whether the individuals are religious or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the minimum requirement of the PN Board and its committees&lt;br /&gt; (mentioned hereinafter) to organize at least three events per academic year of the&lt;br /&gt; following:&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull; Social events.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull; Cultural events.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull; Academic events.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull; Community service engagements in the wider Ann Arbor area.&lt;br /&gt; In addition, the PN website must be kept up-to-date, serving current and&lt;br /&gt; prospective members as well as sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>The Stock Trading Crew of Berkeley brings anyone who is interested in trading stocks on a short term time frame together.  We do NOT “invest” in stocks. We “trade” stocks that have great technicals and positive future catalysts.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;We plan to work together, sharing and debating about ideas, using technical, fundamental, and derivatives analysis to generate the greatest return possible in a short period of time with minimal risk. We do NOT &amp;ldquo;invest&amp;rdquo; in stocks. We simply &amp;ldquo;trade&amp;rdquo; stocks that have great technicals and positive future catalysts that will propel the stock forward in only a couple weeks or months. Members will learn and trade (paper trade or trade with their own real accounts if experienced) alongside with other members during the day, utilizing the three types of analyses described above. Members will meet either in person or online in a proposed chatroom between the hours of 6:30am-1pm from Monday thru Friday - whenever members have the time to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>Swipes for the Homeless aims to tangibly and tactically partner with college campuses to alleviate hunger while raising college students’ awareness of homelessness and hunger, which is prevalent in their community, through education and outreach. </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Swipes for the Homeless is an international, 501(c)3 non-profit organization consisting of a coalition of university and college chapters located throughout the world. Their dual mission is to tangibly and tactically partner with college campuses to alleviate hunger while raising college students&amp;rsquo; awareness of homelessness and hunger, which is prevalent in their community, through education and outreach. Swipes for the Homeless was established as a student organization in the Fall of 2009 at the University of California, Los Angeles. &amp;nbsp;The organization has now established successful chapters at University of Southern California, University of Paris in France, University of California, Santa Barbara, University of California at Irvine, and University of California at San Diego. Ultimately, Swipes for the Homeless is a broad-based collaborative initiative among university students who are assisting in alleviating the neighboring homeless populations through programs and events among university communities, in hopes of eventually impeding hunger and homelessness.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <ShortName>BIG</ShortName>
      <Summary>BIG aims to unite a community of students excited about immigration law.  </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;To that end, we hope to connect students with immigration experts, advocate for advanced immigration courses, organize career-related as well as substantive speaker panels, and support local efforts to help students and low-wage workers regularize their immigration status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIG&amp;rsquo;s goals include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providing a mechanism for law students to network with professors, alums working in immigration, Bay Area immigration activists, and undergraduate students.&lt;br /&gt; Building upon our growing immigration program by advocating for more classes, such as a Crimmigration class or an upper-level Immigration class.&lt;br /&gt; Co-hosting speaker events with other immigration-minded student groups like CARC and La Raza, among others. These events will give students the chance to learn about different areas of immigration law and see how it intersects with other legal studies. &lt;br /&gt; Connecting students with local volunteer efforts to help identify undocumented immigrants who are eligible for various forms of legal relief.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We love the Lord Jesus Christ, endeavor to give Him &amp;ldquo;the first place in all things&amp;rdquo; (Col. 1:18), and have the utmost respect for His Word. We meet simply as Christians without any denominational affiliation because we treasure the testimony of the oneness of the Body of Christ, and our desire is to cooperate with Him for the accomplishment of God&amp;rsquo;s eternal purpose (Eph. 3:11) by ministering the unsearchable riches of Christ (Eph. 3:18) for the building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;We warmly receive all believers as our brothers and sisters in Christ and seek to maintain the oneness of the Spirit by keeping our focus on Christ.&amp;nbsp;In addition to pursuing fellowship, we also desire to strengthen and spread the Lord&amp;rsquo;s testimony on the UC Berkeley campus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>We improve the health, educational and social outcomes for kids living in struggling communities through the power of service and sports.

If you would like to coach check out: http://www.coachingcorps.org/coach/</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;We are a Corps of motivated college students and community members who serve as volunteer coaches, mentors and role models in afterschool sports programs serving girls and boys who live in some of our most under-resourced communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We exist to ensure that for all kids, the opportunity to run, play, learn, be coached and work with a team is a given &amp;ndash; not a luxury. We are Coaching Corps and we are changing the game for the kids who need us most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface, what we do may look easy &amp;ndash; we offer a full-season of sports programs for kids who normally wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get them.&amp;nbsp; We pair up with another Coaching Corps coach and we create teams, design drills, give high-fives and coach our kids through wins and losses on and off the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look deeper, we are more than just coaches.&amp;nbsp; We promote positive peer relationships, inspire leadership in kids and ensure the emotional and physical safety of all our athletes.&amp;nbsp; We know there is no life lesson that sports can&amp;rsquo;t teach &amp;hellip; and we teach those lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, 3,000 of us have changed the game for more than 30,000 kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we offer our afterschool partners a range of crucial support, including training and consulting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are a community of advocates. Through our research and special initiatives, we raise awareness of the disparity in opportunity for populations most in need such as girls in low-income communities. And we educate policymakers and opinion leaders on the importance of ensuring that all kids have a chance to play &amp;ndash; and experience the life-changing benefits of sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have embarked on an ambitious goal to change the game for 300,000 kids across the nation over the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>To unite the male and female energies on this planet, starting with boosting women's self-esteem and self-mastery, and thus taking their rightful place next to men and creating a new world order of unity and balance.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;The way to a successful college experience is the ability to handle stress and maintain mental balance, which is best achieved through self-esteem and self-mastery. These attributes provide the confidence to handle situations with grace and humor and to have the inner resources to deal with challenges of all types. Our approach is tried and true--we teach women self-esteem through mindfulness practices that spur self-awareness, and to gain self-mastery we offer engaging activities in success principles, meditation, and self-discovery&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Generation Citizen envisions a democracy in which every citizen participates. We strengthen our nation&amp;rsquo;s democracy by empowering young people to become engaged and effective citizens, starting now. &amp;nbsp;We&amp;nbsp;partner college student Democracy Coaches with classroom teachers to teach an action civics course in which teens solve problems they are facing in their own communities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Club is ran in the form of a DeCal:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;DeCal will be one of the requirements for participation in Generation Citizen at Cal. Students commit to attending and participating in the DeCal seminars as well as the classroom meetings at an assigned middle or high school in Berkeley, Oakland or Richmond. The DeCal serves as a seminar where the Democracy Coaches will receive ongoing support, ask questions, plan lessons, share the experiences they have with their middle- or high-school class.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Throughout this course, we will learn about local political structures, classroom management tips and strategies for student motivation and engagement. We will also discuss the previous and upcoming weeks&amp;rsquo; classroom outcomes, and strategies for increasing the presence of Generation Citizen at UC Berkeley.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>International Service Learning (ISL) is a nonprofit organization that offers health services to underserved populations around the world. Our Berkeley chapter recruits students for medical/pharmacy, dental, and optometry trips.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Service Learning (ISL) is a nonprofit organization that has sent thousands of students all over the world to volunteer in underserved communities. For the 2013-14 academic year, our Berkeley chapter will recruit students for&amp;nbsp;medical/pharmacy, dental, and optometry teams. Our primary teams will travel to Central America during Cal's Spring Break. We will also be supporting smaller teams interested in traveling together during Winter Break. Before the trips, we will hold workshops to learn about the diagnosis and treatment of common health problems, medical Spanish, and basic techniques relating to your field. We also plan to fundraise to help subsidize the cost of the trip and collect donated supplies and medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a really great experience for anyone interested in the health field, as you will gain hands-on experience while helping communities that lack access to healthcare and resources necessary for their basic well-being. You will work closely with health professionals and interact directly with patients, while also having a ton of fun with your peers! Keep a lookout for our recruitment info sessions towards the middle of the Fall Semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or you'd like to join our mailing list, plese email islatberkeley@gmail.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read on for further details about the teams and how to get involved!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Apply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recruit members for our Spring Break teams towards the middle of the Fall Semester. Keep an eye out for our infosession announcements. After the infosession(s), an application form will be sent out to everyone who attended and everyone on our mailing list. This application will be due approximately a week later. We will let you know if you have been accepted into one of our teams before the Thanksgiving weekend. After you hear from us, you must sign up on ISL&amp;rsquo;s official website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.islonline.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.islonline.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical/Pharmacy Team - Sample Trip Activities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRACTICAL MEDICAL SEMINAR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day after our arrival, we had an all-day seminar to prepare ourselves for the work we would be doing at our mobile clinic. Two local doctors, assisted by our official ISL team leader, led the seminar. First we did an overview of various ailments that we would likely encounter at our mobile clinic, such as urinary tract infections, COPD, and gastrointestinal worms. The information given emphasized the symptoms of the ailments, and this was very helpful for us later when we were diagnosing patients at our mobile clinic. In addition, we were given extensive handouts on the various medications that could be given to treat the ailments. These handouts included dosage information for children versus adults, which was also very useful during our mobile clinics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the seminar emphasized practical skills. We were given step-by-step instructions on how to efficiently perform triage. During this portion of the seminar, we were instructed on the proper use of stethoscopes, blood pressure cuffs, glucometers, and urine test strips. We were also taught various ways of using our sense of hearing and our sense of touch to identify potential ailments in a patient. Having the opportunity to practice these skills on our teammates greatly increased our confidence and efficiency during our mobile clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the medical seminar covered some basic medical Spanish, in addition to general patient interaction skills. While it is not necessary to speak Spanish to go on the trip (ISL provides excellent translators), we all felt closer to our patients when we were able to ask them simple questions like, &amp;ldquo;&amp;iquest;C&amp;oacute;mo est&amp;aacute; usted?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;&amp;iquest;D&amp;oacute;nde le duele?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOUSE VISITS TO THE COMMUNITY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, we visited the village where we would later be setting up our mobile clinic. In groups of 3 or 4, we went door-to-door with a local ISL guide asking members of the community about their living and health conditions. Besides taking the opportunity to advertise for our mobile clinic, the public health data we gathered would later be analyzed by ISL to determine some of the overarching health trends in the community, which they could use to improve their mobile clinics. It was a very eye-opening experience to see the homes and lifestyles of the local people. It was interesting to observe how the houses grew noticeably less well-built the further we moved from the town center, how many families used wood as their primary fuel for cooking, how important a bicycle could be for transportation, and how infrequently many individuals saw a doctor or other health professional. The villagers were exceptionally kind and welcoming. All in all it was a very rewarding experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MOBILE CLINIC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the following three days of our trip we worked at a mobile clinic that we set up in the village of La Concha. There, we set up stations where groups of 4 students and one ISL translator would see patients. Two doctors oversaw the groups and a couple of students manned a pharmacy table where patients would go after they were seen by one of the groups. In each group, students took turns doing triage. We measured the height and weight of the patients, took their blood pressure, and depending on what they came in for, we also measured their blood glucose levels and analyzed urine samples. We were given standardized intake sheets for the patients where we could record such information in addition to age, family health history, etc. This mobile clinic served as a great learning experience for students, as we were allowed to practice diagnosing and prescribing treatments for the patients. Afterwards, one of the doctors would come and correct us if we had made any errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw a variety of patients. For example, there was a child with gastrointestinal worms, a man whose painful abdominal hernia prevented him from working, and several women with vaginal and urinary tract infections. For some of the patients, such as the women with urinary tract infections, we were easily able to come up with a diagnosis and we knew exactly which medications to prescribe. However, there were other patients for whom we could do nothing. We were not able to give the man with the hernia anything except painkillers, because we lacked the manpower and equipment to give him the surgery he needed. In addition, each morning over 80 people would be lined up in front of our clinic before we even arrived, and over the course of our working day we would barely be able to see half of them. The experience of both successfully helping someone and being unable to help others was the most inspiring part of the ISL experience for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOSPITAL VISIT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One afternoon we visited a local hospital. It was very interesting to observe how the hospital functioned. Our local ISL representative explained how the hospital was understaffed, so only patients who are very sick but who the doctors believe they have a good chance of curing get admitted. Most of these admitted patients get put up in beds in the hospital&amp;rsquo;s main sickroom. This sickroom was a long, corridor-like room with slightly over a dozen beds lined along one wall. When we visited the hospital, we helped the nurses take blood pressure, blood sugar levels, etc. of the patients in the sickroom. In addition, we were able to observe several surgeries that were scheduled during our visit. Unlike in an American hospital, we were able to stand inside one of the hospital&amp;rsquo;s two operating theaters to observe surgery. The most common surgeries are C-sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RECREATIONAL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our trip also featured plenty of recreational activities. For example, we visited an active volcano, a political prison, a zip-lining park, and a market fair. One of the highlights of the trip was a visit to a local elementary school. Beforehand, we went shopping for toys to give to the children. At the school we played games with the children (including batting a pi&amp;ntilde;ata!) and gave them the toys as prizes. Lastly, the food throughout the trip was amazing, and our hotel was very quaint. There was ample time at the hotel to bond with fellow ISL teammates or get some homework done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dental Team Activities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DENTAL EDUCATION SEMINAR&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first full day of the trip, we were visited by one of the dentists who would be working with us for the week. She had brought with her a large assortment of dental equipment as well as a powerpoint presentation of what we will be going over during the next few days. Of course, we had been prepped with the information prior to coming to Nicaragua but going over the information was a lot more reassuring. We went over dental procedures (extractions, fillings, cleanings), dental tools (mirror, explorer, elevators, condensers and etc), dental issues (plaque build up and current oral health issues) as well as Spanish dental terminology! Afterwards she went over a general idea of what we were going to do over the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PATIENT RECRUITMENT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, we arrived at a small village which was located next to the temporary clinic that we would be working at. In small groups, we were split in pairs with a dentist (also our translator/guide) who took us around the village to recruit all the patients we would be treating over the next few days. Door to door, we went around doing basic check-ups (looking for severity and urgency of dental care) and asked a quick survey of questions regarding dental and oral health. Then we gave them a small presentation on oral care and small tips that they should keep in mind regarding oral health. There was definitely plenty of experience on trying what little Spanish we learned from before or during the trip. Once we made appointments to those who needed care, we moved to the next house. Most were gracious and gave us mangos, star fruits and other amazing delights!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLINIC WORK DAYS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the days that everyone was looking forward to. We had our equipment and we had the patients; all we needed was to get some dental work done! The morning of, we arrived at the church that lent their space for us to work at and set up a temporary dental clinic. We had chairs, sterilizing and dental equipment donated to us through ISL and a local Dental School so setting up was a good learning experience. The chairs were set, the dental tools were placed on a large long table in the middle and the sterilizing equipment was placed towards the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will have to say, the next part of the trip was such a rewarding time. The dental experience is indispensable. Each dentist was paired with two of us and we were given the opportunity to assist in every procedure. As patients were seated in the chair, the dentist did an exam and assessed what the patient needed most. Having been prepped with dental procedures we then proceeded to pick out the instruments we needed for the patient. Next to the patient, we took part in fillings, extractions and cleanings. Of course, with enough practice, we were sometimes asked to help more. It was by far the most engaging dental-related activity I had ever done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took most of us a while to learn how to handle the tools and equipment at first but with real patients, it was just amazing to see how fast we learned. It was just the rawest experience that any one of us would get and soon, we were adept with our tasks that we were doing things even without the dentist having to ask us. By the end of the day, things just seemed natural. Day after day, we were getting better and more efficient. Each patient was different and even with the same procedures; it always felt different and new. Things never got boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RECREATIONAL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, as much work we put in, we were having as much fun. Our guide took us to amazing restaurants (truly unforgettable), active volcano sites, bat caves, and even cultural shows! There was seriously just so much that we were always doing something. Even in our free time back in our hotel, we were busy eating mangos that just naturally seemed to grow everywhere and meeting people every day. I still often think back to the nice weather that simply enveloped your skin while I gazed at the lovely skies on a rocking chair with a juicy mango in my hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optometry Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Optometry Team will get to work alongside optometrists, perform eye exams, examine common eye problems in underserved communities of the country, and learn to use optometric Spanish to interact with patients.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <Name>Learning Enterprises at Berkeley</Name>
      <Status>Active</Status>
      <ShortName />
      <Summary>The purpose of this organization is to start a new, active campus of the non-profit organization “Learning Enterprises”. This organization sends volunteers to several countries around the world to teach English. </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;The organization will adopt LE&amp;rsquo;s mission and goals, which are stated on the website: www.learningenterprises.org as &amp;ldquo;(1) fostering creativity, (2) using the English language as a means of communication, (3) cross-cultural exchange, (4) spreading the spirit of volunteerism, and (5) providing substantive and rewarding work experience for young people&amp;rdquo;. The goals of this organization specifically will be to spread the word about LE, recruit applicants from our campus, provide support for applicants who are chosen, and ultimately send successful student volunteers around the world to teach English. There will also be a focus on fundraising for the organization LE as a whole, as well as for our individual LE campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning Enterprises is an incredible non-profit organization that sends young volunteers to teach English abroad during the summer. This organization will aim to recruit students to apply to an LE program abroad (we have over 10 programs for this coming summer). After interviewing with the Campus Director (Neha Shah, the founder of this organization at Berkeley) and the Program Director (the director of the program to which the student is applying), volunteers will be selected. This organization will then train the selected volunteers on the ways of successfully teaching ESL in a different country. This training will include discussions on creating a curriculum for a summer of teaching, how a volunteer can provide additional services to his/her community (for example a service project at a volunteer's school), and how to adjust to living with a host family and experiencing a cultural immersion. On the whole, this organization wants to spread the word about LE and give students at Berkeley an opportunity to volunteer abroad in a school where English teachers are needed. The organization will also work to fundraise for LE as a whole and for the Berkeley subdivision of LE.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Name>Pennies for Patients Committee at Berkeley</Name>
      <Status>Frozen</Status>
      <ShortName />
      <Summary>This committee will bring the Pennies for Patients project to the campus. Through classroom presentations, posters around campus, and seminars, we hope to collect funds in specially marked boxes to donate to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Our proposed organization is unique because we are dedicated to just the Pennies for Patients project that has not been introduced to the UC Berkeley campus yet. We believe that having such a specific focus will allow us to put in all our efforts into raising funds for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, an organization committed to cure several blood cancers, raise cancer awareness, and improve the quality of life of patients and their families. We also hope to develop empathy and respect for all people who struggle with these forms of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>But everything exposed by the light becomes visible, for it is light that makes everything visible. This is why it is said: “Wake up, O sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.” (Ephesians 5:13-14)</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Rise! Campus Ministry is devoted to teaching students the Bible and helping them give up everything to follow Christ according to His Words.&amp;nbsp; Our goal is raise up a new generation of sold-out disciples of Jesus who will go out into the world shining God's light on people of all nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghandi encouraged us to "be the change we want to see in the world" -- through application of the Scriptures God allows us to be that change through Jesus Christ.&amp;nbsp; The true light of the world will rise and bring real change when men and women make radical decisions to follow God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our group holds weekly Bible discussions, offers individual studies to students and members of the community, and holds devotionals and worship services on campus.&amp;nbsp; Our standard is the Word of God.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;p&gt;We will host weekly discussions about current issues concerning college women and propose solutions to these issues as a team as well. &amp;nbsp;We want to provide women with the resources and support system they need to achieve their ambitions. We will do this by installing a member-to-member mentorship system and inviting keynote speakers to group meetings. These key note speeches will be given by successful women on the UC Berkeley campus, within the community, or else where. They will give speeches regarding their career trajectories and will serve as mentors to group members.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <ShortName>CFB</ShortName>
      <Summary>Interact with corporate finance professionals through educational presentations
Develop critical understanding of the profession
Reach out networking opportunities &amp; meet new friends with mutual goals and interests
Engage in targeting job opportunities</Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;While UC Berkeley encompasses many business-related clubs with concentrations on areas such as consulting, marketing, and investment banking; there does not exist a club focused on the topic of corporate finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aim to prepare our members with the confidence and skills to begin fulfilling careers in corporate finance, an emerging field with rapidly growing interest. Corporate finance involves helping firms make financial decisions by analyzing sources of funding and the capital structure of corporations, with the aim of increasing the firms&amp;rsquo; value to shareholders. There has been an increasing amount of interest in corporate financing, and many potential employers visit UC Berkeley each year to recruit qualified students with intended careers in corporate finance. Our club will serve as the intermediate between interested students and their intended jobs or internships by preparing them from the ground up with career exploration, resume critique, and mock interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we will provide our members with practice and real experience in corporate finance. We will invite finance companies to Berkeley and give our members case competitions for training. We will also invite professionals with knowledge and experience in corporate finance to advice club members in preparation for both case competitions and potential interviews. Finally, we will teach essential skills to members &amp;ndash; the valuation of firms and basic company analysis &amp;ndash; through inviting professors and MBA students as guest speakers.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Summary>Reformed University Fellowship is a Christian fellowship comprised of Cal students, seeking to thoughtfully and respectfully communicate the love and truth of Jesus Christ. </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Through community, prayer, worship, and teaching, RUF endeavors to help students mature in their understanding of the Christian faith as expressed in the Reformed theological tradition. Though RUF is Presbyterian in affiliation, it welcomes students from all walks of life and religious backgrounds. Moreover, an atmosphere and community of respectful and honest discussion is desired, as students explore the Christian faith and wrestle with how that faith integrates into all of life; that is, RUF seeks to be a servant of the university as it ministers to the whole student: emotionally, socially, academically, and spiritually.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <ShortName />
      <Summary>The Senior Gift Committee allows students interested in keeping UC Berkeley great by taking an active part in learning about and promoting philanthropy at Cal.  </Summary>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Every year, seniors celebrate their graduation and new alumni status by coming &lt;br /&gt; together as a class to make a gift to the&amp;nbsp; University. This longstanding tradition gives seniors the opportunity to make an impact on the lives of future Cal students just as past generations of alumni have done for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students on the Senior Gift Committee gain valuable resume-building experience in communication, project and volunteer management while inspiring their classmates to give to Cal through the Senior Gift Campaign. The Senior Gift Campaign raises over $100,000 each year to support student life at UC Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>
